# Ideas / Someday

Stuff to consider, no commitment.

- notion integration for docs/knowledge base
- github integration for repo monitoring
- voice mode improvements (wake word? continuous?)
- mobile node pairing (phone camera/location access)
- custom slash commands per workflow
- scheduled reports (daily summary to #logs)
