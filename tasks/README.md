# Tasks

Persistent task tracking for Ventok.

## Structure

- `active.md` — current tasks, priorities
- `done.md` — completed (archive)
- `ideas.md` — backlog, someday/maybe

## Workflow

1. New task → add to `active.md` with status
2. Post to discord #tasks for visibility
3. React ✅ when done, move to `done.md`
4. React 🔄 when in progress

## Statuses

- `[ ]` — todo
- `[~]` — in progress  
- `[x]` — done
- `[!]` — blocked
- `[?]` — needs clarification
