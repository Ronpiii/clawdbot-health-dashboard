## nightly build: weekly momentum tracker (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc orbit` — compares this week to last week across 5 dimensions
- dimensions: commits, log coverage, tasks completed, lines added, nightly builds
- per-dimension trend arrows (up/down/flat) with delta and percentage
- sparkline history across N weeks (default 4, configurable up to 12)
- net momentum score (-100 to +100) with weighted formula
- verdict system: accelerating / gaining momentum / cruising / decelerating / stalling
- smart week-boundary handling: when it's early in the week (mon/tue with no activity), automatically compares last 2 full weeks instead of showing meaningless -100%

### first run results
- momentum: -53 (stalling) — last week had 23 commits vs 144 the week before
- 100% log coverage both weeks (stable)
- 7 nightly builds both weeks (consistent)
- 25k lines added last week vs 84k the week before (that was anivia sprint)
- sparklines show the post-launch cooldown arc clearly: `█▃▁▁`
- the -53 is accurate — it's measuring the natural deceleration after a big push, not a problem

### commands
- `arc orbit` — full dashboard with box layout
- `arc orbit --short` — one-liner momentum reading
- `arc orbit --json` — machine-readable
- `arc orbit --weeks N` — expand sparkline history (2-12 weeks)
- aliases: `arc orbit`, `arc momentum`

### why
- 20+ arc tools, each showing one slice. none showed the TREND.
- `arc health` = snapshot. `arc wins` = accomplishments. `arc streak` = consistency.
- orbit = trajectory. are things speeding up or slowing down? that's the question worth answering.
- the sparkline is the killer feature: `█▃▁▁` tells a story that no single number can.
- designed to run weekly (or whenever you wonder "am i doing more or less than last week?")

## deep research: ventok strategic positioning (07:20-08:30 UTC)

### trigger
- ron shared a tweet about someone who built 3 products + 3 AI agents in 7 days for $600
- sparked conversation about how AI workflows are restructuring operations
- ron asked for deep research on workflow shifts, optimal positioning, and avoiding obsolescence
- then requested deep dives on all 5 sub-topics

### deliverables (saved to research/)
1. **workflow-shift-2026.md** — overview: the shift is real, solo builders + agents compressing team-scale work
2. **clay-playbook.md** — reverse-engineered clay's $0→$100M ARR journey. key: 6 years finding PMF, then 2 years explosive growth. wedge→moat→platform→ecosystem pattern.
3. **deliverability-moat.md** — technical deep dive on why email infra is defensible. time-based (warming), relationship-based (ISPs), scale-based (data network effects). agents CAN'T build this.
4. **agency-model.md** — cold email agency landscape: 5,000-15,000 agencies, pain points (DNS hell, 200+ mailbox management), revenue models ($2,500/mo avg client value, 60-80% margins)
5. **competitive-teardown.md** — instantly ($37/mo, simple) vs smartlead (agency-first, closest competitor) vs clay ($5B, data layer, complementary) vs apollo (all-in-one, weak infra)
6. **agent-api-design.md** — full technical spec: MCP server design, REST API (20+ endpoints), SDK design, 5 agent workflow examples, implementation timeline

### key strategic insight
- ventok/anivia should be "the stripe of outreach" — infrastructure layer that every AI agent uses
- don't compete on intelligence (agents, LLMs). compete on infrastructure (deliverability, compliance, inbox management)
- first to build MCP sending connector for claude/chatgpt wins the space clay doesn't cover
- clay = data connector. anivia = sending connector. complementary positioning.

### ron's reaction
- "i'd like to think you're my jarvis" — wants me to evolve toward full-stack assistant
- interested in the research but taking it in, not rushing to execute

## IT support: rainar's windows 11 issues (08:30-09:28 UTC)
- helped ron troubleshoot rainar's PC remotely via telegram photos
- issue 1: .zip file opening in Word → file association fix
- issue 2: new Outlook app broken with gmail (`ADDriverStoreAccessNonLocalException`) → cleared Olk/OneAuth/IdentityCache folders
- issue 3: windows user password change → Ctrl+Alt+Del method
- all resolved successfully
