## nightly build: weekly momentum tracker (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc orbit` — compares this week to last week across 5 dimensions
- dimensions: commits, log coverage, tasks completed, lines added, nightly builds
- per-dimension trend arrows (up/down/flat) with delta and percentage
- sparkline history across N weeks (default 4, configurable up to 12)
- net momentum score (-100 to +100) with weighted formula
- verdict system: accelerating / gaining momentum / cruising / decelerating / stalling
- smart week-boundary handling: when it's early in the week (mon/tue with no activity), automatically compares last 2 full weeks instead of showing meaningless -100%

### first run results
- momentum: -53 (stalling) — last week had 23 commits vs 144 the week before
- 100% log coverage both weeks (stable)
- 7 nightly builds both weeks (consistent)
- 25k lines added last week vs 84k the week before (that was anivia sprint)
- sparklines show the post-launch cooldown arc clearly: `█▃▁▁`
- the -53 is accurate — it's measuring the natural deceleration after a big push, not a problem

### commands
- `arc orbit` — full dashboard with box layout
- `arc orbit --short` — one-liner momentum reading
- `arc orbit --json` — machine-readable
- `arc orbit --weeks N` — expand sparkline history (2-12 weeks)
- aliases: `arc orbit`, `arc momentum`

### why
- 20+ arc tools, each showing one slice. none showed the TREND.
- `arc health` = snapshot. `arc wins` = accomplishments. `arc streak` = consistency.
- orbit = trajectory. are things speeding up or slowing down? that's the question worth answering.
- the sparkline is the killer feature: `█▃▁▁` tells a story that no single number can.
- designed to run weekly (or whenever you wonder "am i doing more or less than last week?")
