## nightly build (00:00 UTC)

### arc git — multi-repo git dashboard
- `scripts/git-repos.mjs` — scans all .git dirs in workspace (up to 3 levels deep)
- shows: branch, changes (staged/modified/untracked), unpushed commits, last commit info, stale branches
- dirty repos sorted first, action items at bottom
- color-coded: ● dirty (yellow), ▲ unpushed (cyan), ✓ clean (green), ○ no remote (dim)
- flags: `--short`, `--json`, `<repo>` filter
- registered as `arc git` / `arc repos` in CLI
- current state: 6 repos found, 4 dirty (clawd, discord-voice-bot, context-memory, ventok-site)
- posted to discord #logs

## collabo project (01:00-02:00 UTC)

### ron asked to research, audit, and fix collabo (PM tool)
- cloned Ronpiii/collabo from github
- full codebase audit: 154 files, next.js 16 + react 19 + supabase + tailwind
- read existing AUDIT.md, CLEANUP_PLAN.md, REMAINING_DEBT.md
- agency model (workspaces → clients → projects → tasks) is strong differentiator

### TASKS.md created — 90 items across 4 phases
- phase 1: health (security, errors, perf, tests) — 22 items
- phase 2: core features (kanban, realtime, shortcuts, recurring) — 28 items
- phase 3: growth (gantt, automations, guests, reporting) — 27 items
- phase 4: polish (landing, AI, mobile) — 13 items

### phase 1 fixes completed
- ERR-1: error toasts on inbox + task-overview pages
- PERF-1: N+1 query fix (4 queries → 1 nested select)
- SEC-3: rate limiting on auth endpoints (10 req/min per IP)
- LINT-1: replaced all <img> with next/image (5 files)
- fixed error boundary theme colors
- configured next.config.ts for supabase remote images
- phase 1 at 45%, overall at 12%

## collabo autonomous sprint (01:15-02:30 UTC)

### ron greenlit autonomous work on collabo
- "I'll trust you'll make good decisions with Collabo"

### phase 1 completion push (68%)

- ERR-4: loading skeletons for all 7 main pages (Skeleton component library)
- PERF-2: React.memo on TaskRow and TaskCard components
- SEC-5: input sanitization utility (HTML stripping, length limits, injection detection)

### phase 2 core features started (21%)
- **kanban board view** — full drag-and-drop between status columns
  - native HTML5 DnD (no external deps), columns by status, cards with priority/due/assignees
  - ViewToggle extended with board icon, wired into project page
- **keyboard shortcuts** — global shortcut system
  - useKeyboardShortcuts + useGoShortcuts hooks
  - N = new task, ? = help modal, G+D/P/I/T/M/S = navigate
  - shortcuts help modal with all bindings
  - ignores inputs/textareas automatically

### progress: phase 1 at 68%, phase 2 at 21%, overall at 24% (22/90 items)
