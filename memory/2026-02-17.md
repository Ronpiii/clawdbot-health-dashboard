## nightly build: daily action planner (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc plan` — ranked daily action planner
- synthesizes tasks, git state, blockers, stale projects, and recent activity into prioritized "what to work on today" list
- scoring engine: base priority from task section + modifiers for revenue impact, momentum, effort, staleness
- effort estimation and tagging from natural language (auto-detects revenue/client/launch/cleanup items)
- blocked projects filtered from git suggestions (discord-voice-bot won't show as "commit this")
- stale project detection: surfaces repos with >7d inactivity
- day-of-week contextual advice

### first run
- TMW meeting prep: 100 (revenue + client-facing + high priority)
- ventok outreach: 100 (revenue + high priority)
- anivia landing page: 70 (quick win)
- anivia phase 2: 60 (backlog)
- tuner unpushed: 55 (git hygiene)
- 2 blocked items shown separately
- 3 stale projects flagged (discord-voice-bot 104d, anivia 12d, bore 12d)

### tuning
- initial version scored dirty git repos too high (base 55 + in-progress 25 = 80, outranking real tasks)
- fixed: lowered git hygiene base to 40-45, removed false in-progress flag, filter blocked project repos
- result: real business tasks properly dominate, git hygiene is secondary

### commands
- `arc plan` — full dashboard with score bars and reasoning
- `arc plan --short` — top 3 one-liners
- `arc plan --week` — broader view with ideas section
- `arc plan --json` — machine-readable
- aliases: `arc plan`, `arc agenda`

## design research deep dive for ron (11:16-13:25 UTC)

### trigger
- ron asked to transcribe a youtube video on SaaS UI/UX mistakes (vibecoded apps)
- then asked to extract actionable rules from it
- then asked to transcribe a second video on color theory
- escalated to "research the top designers' rules" and then "I want to know EVERYTHING"

### deliverables (saved to workspace root)
1. **ui-design-rules.md** — initial ruleset from 2 youtube videos (icons, color, layout, density, pricing, analytics, landing pages)
2. **design-research.md** (~25K words) — comprehensive rulebook from top designers: Refactoring UI, Erik Kennedy, Dieter Rams, Laws of UX, Ian Storm Taylor, Material Design, Linear, Vercel, Stripe, Notion
3. **design-mastery.md** (~24K words) — the psychology/craft layer: Don Norman's emotional design, Rauno Keskküla's invisible interaction details, Nielsen's heuristics, retention psychology, conversion design
4. **master-design-prompt.md** (~19K words) — all 3 merged into a single system prompt, deduplicated and organized for AI consumption

### key insight
- ron strongly prefers monochrome-first (black/white/gray) approach — tried pencil.dev and hated the AI-chosen colors
- the master prompt leads with monochrome-first philosophy and exact hex values
- structured as drop-in .cursorrules or system prompt

### ron's vibe
- deep interest in design craft today, exploring vibe coding tools (pencil.dev)
- wants to build SaaS UIs that look professional, not "vibecoded"
