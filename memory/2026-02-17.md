## nightly build: daily action planner (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc plan` — ranked daily action planner
- synthesizes tasks, git state, blockers, stale projects, and recent activity into prioritized "what to work on today" list
- scoring engine: base priority from task section + modifiers for revenue impact, momentum, effort, staleness
- effort estimation and tagging from natural language (auto-detects revenue/client/launch/cleanup items)
- blocked projects filtered from git suggestions (discord-voice-bot won't show as "commit this")
- stale project detection: surfaces repos with >7d inactivity
- day-of-week contextual advice

### first run
- TMW meeting prep: 100 (revenue + client-facing + high priority)
- ventok outreach: 100 (revenue + high priority)
- anivia landing page: 70 (quick win)
- anivia phase 2: 60 (backlog)
- tuner unpushed: 55 (git hygiene)
- 2 blocked items shown separately
- 3 stale projects flagged (discord-voice-bot 104d, anivia 12d, bore 12d)

### tuning
- initial version scored dirty git repos too high (base 55 + in-progress 25 = 80, outranking real tasks)
- fixed: lowered git hygiene base to 40-45, removed false in-progress flag, filter blocked project repos
- result: real business tasks properly dominate, git hygiene is secondary

### commands
- `arc plan` — full dashboard with score bars and reasoning
- `arc plan --short` — top 3 one-liners
- `arc plan --week` — broader view with ideas section
- `arc plan --json` — machine-readable
- aliases: `arc plan`, `arc agenda`
