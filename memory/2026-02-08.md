# 2026-02-08

## afternoon proactive work (14:00 UTC)

### inode crisis resolved
- disk was at 256k/256k inode limit — git commits failing
- root cause: node_modules in 3 inactive projects (collabo-v2, tuner, ventok-site) eating ~71k inodes
- nuked their node_modules → 185k inodes, breathing room restored
- source code preserved, just need `npm install` if any project revives

### memory maintenance
- ran compress-logs.mjs: 48 completed items across 9 daily logs
- updated MEMORY.md with feb learnings (supply chain attacks, arc shield, brave api gap)
- committed + pushed

### ron sick day
- ron resting, told me to do whatever today
- sent morning curiosity drop (waymo world model, france office suite, coding agents debate)

## nightly build: arc shield (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc shield` — workspace security scanner
- 15 secret detection patterns, supply chain audit, git hygiene, .env coverage
- handles nested git repos + submodules (detects `.git` dirs, checks each repo's own .gitignore)
- scoring: 0-100 with severity breakdown
- flags: `--quick`, `--fix`, `--json`

### security fixes applied
- **critical:** stripped embedded GitHub PAT from anivia git remote (`ghp_...@github.com`)
- **critical:** added `.env` patterns to root .gitignore (was missing)
- score went 0 → 70 (full) / 91 (quick) after fixes
- remaining: 4 high (test secrets + eval in build scripts), 21 low (discord webhooks, base64 — all legitimate)

### context
- born from yesterday's clawdhub supply chain attack discussion
- found a real PAT token on first scan — exactly the kind of thing that causes incidents
