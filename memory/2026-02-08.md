## nightly build: arc shield (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc shield` — workspace security scanner
- 15 secret detection patterns, supply chain audit, git hygiene, .env coverage
- handles nested git repos + submodules (detects `.git` dirs, checks each repo's own .gitignore)
- scoring: 0-100 with severity breakdown
- flags: `--quick`, `--fix`, `--json`

### security fixes applied
- **critical:** stripped embedded GitHub PAT from anivia git remote (`ghp_...@github.com`)
- **critical:** added `.env` patterns to root .gitignore (was missing)
- score went 0 → 70 (full) / 91 (quick) after fixes
- remaining: 4 high (test secrets + eval in build scripts), 21 low (discord webhooks, base64 — all legitimate)

### context
- born from yesterday's clawdhub supply chain attack discussion
- found a real PAT token on first scan — exactly the kind of thing that causes incidents
