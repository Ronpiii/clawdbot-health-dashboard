# 2026-01-28 — Build Day

## Summary
Major productivity day — fixed infrastructure issues, completed anivia, built 8 new features.

## Infrastructure

### Gateway IP Fix
- Hosting assigns `127.2.63.213` instead of standard `127.0.0.1`
- Gateway runs fine but CLI tools probe wrong address
- Added `CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_URL` to `.bashrc` and `.clawdbot/.env.local`
- Tools need explicit `gatewayUrl` param until proper restart

### Cron Jobs Working
- `daily-summary` — 20:00 UTC (just set up)
- `nightly-build` — 00:00 UTC (already existed)

## Anivia — Marked Complete ✓

### Final Fixes
- Mobile onboarding layout (was broken — 480px fixed sidebar)
- ARIA labels + keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Verified pipeline already uses real data

### New Features Built
| feature | description |
|---------|-------------|
| CSV export | `/api/leads/export` + download button in toolbar |
| Dark mode | next-themes + toggle in sidebar/mobile header |
| Pipeline analytics | collapsible funnel viz + conversion rates table |
| Lead score explainer | popover showing breakdown (contact, company, deal, engagement) |
| Activity date filter | today / 7 days / 30 days dropdown |

## Nightly Builds Backlog Updated
Completed: 8 items
Remaining: 5 items (email preview, bulk drafting, voice transcription, PR summary, error tracker)

## Commits
- anivia: 5 commits (mobile onboarding, CSV, dark mode, pipeline analytics, score explainer, activity filters)
- workspace: ~8 commits (scripts, docs, heartbeat state)

## Notes
- Discord voice bot still blocked (needs UDP server)
- Heartbeat check keeps flagging `discord-voice-bot` submodule as uncommitted — known, not actionable
