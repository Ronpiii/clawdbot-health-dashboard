## nightly build (00:00 UTC)

### arc blockers — unified blocker dashboard
- `scripts/blockers.mjs` — scans all markdown for blocked/waiting/missing items
- groups by project, severity-ranked (critical > high > medium)
- smart filtering: skips prose dirs (writing/, research/, marketing/), instruction files
- boosts tasks/active.md items since those are explicitly tracked
- flags: `--short`, `--json`, `<project>` filter
- registered as `arc blockers` in CLI
- current state: 9 blockers, top critical = vercel pro upgrade
- posted to discord #logs

## morning standup (06:00 UTC)
- morning.mjs hung on wttr.in fetch (timeout) — posted briefing manually via discord webhook
- yesterday recap: anivia phase 3 complete, lead gen rebuild, IMAP polling, MCP server, landing page redesign
- top blockers: vercel pro, stripe keys, moltbook API down

## anivia polish sprint (09:40 UTC)
- 5 parallel sub-agents: TS fix, MCP polish, email backfill, arc blockers cmd, log compression
- all completed successfully

## new habit: daily reddit pulse
- ron requested daily morning reddit scan on relevant topics
- added to HEARTBEAT.md morning ritual
- subreddits: r/sales, r/coldoutreach, r/SaaS, r/smallbusiness, r/Emailmarketing, r/EntrepreneurRideAlong
- daily notes saved to memory/reddit/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- purpose: competitive intel, ideas, staying in the loop on what users actually want

## reddit sales research (10:15 UTC)
- full report: projects/ventok/products/reddit-sales-research.md
- 20+ threads, 8 sections: tools ranked, pain points, wishlists, pricing, deliverability, AI sentiment, opportunities, quotes
- key insight: tool fragmentation is #1 pain, anivia's positioning validated
- infrastructure automation deferred (too complex for now)

## post-contact workflow (10:49-11:20 UTC)
- migration 022 run live in supabase
- built: task manager, reply composer, deal outcome, send-reply API, backfill script
- pushed to github (commit a864600), vercel auto-deploying
- sub-agent files didn't persist — had to rebuild manually (lesson logged)

## sub-agent investigation (11:14 UTC)
- root cause found: sessions_spawn creates sessions but tools aren't bound
- model receives system prompt describing tools, generates text-formatted `<tool_call>` XML
- then hallucinates `<tool_result>` responses — never actually executes anything
- every sub-agent session: exactly 1 user msg + 1 assistant msg (no tool turns)
- config is correct: `tools.subagents.tools.allow: ["all"]`
- confirmed with live test: wrote file via sub-agent, file doesn't exist on disk
- likely clawdbot bug — current v2026.1.23-1, latest v2026.1.24-3
- **workaround**: don't use sessions_spawn for file-writing tasks, do in main session
- **fix**: update clawdbot and retest

## skred messenger
- ron asked about security vs telegram
- P2P, no phone/email/ID required, e2e encrypted, no intermediate servers
- more secure than telegram for 1-on-1. tradeoff: no multi-device, no API/bots
- ron considering for personal use
