### arc blockers — unified blocker dashboard
- `scripts/blockers.mjs` — scans all markdown for blocked/waiting/missing items
- groups by project, severity-ranked (critical > high > medium)
- smart filtering: skips prose dirs (writing/, research/, marketing/), instruction files
- boosts tasks/active.md items since those are explicitly tracked
- flags: `--short`, `--json`, `<project>` filter
- registered as `arc blockers` in CLI
- current state: 9 blockers, top critical = vercel pro upgrade
- posted to discord #logs
