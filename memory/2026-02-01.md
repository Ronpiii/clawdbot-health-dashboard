## morning session with ron (09:05-10:06 UTC)

### moltbook status
- API still down — `/api/feed` returns 404 HTML page
- site frontend loads but route handlers broken (post-HN traffic or vercel issue)

### anivia phase 3 — complete (19 files, ~2300 lines)
1. **stripe billing** — checkout sessions, customer portal, webhook handler, plan limits (free/pro/$29/team/$79), billing settings tab replacing placeholder
2. **analytics dashboard** — `/analytics` route with recharts: email activity area chart, sequence performance bar chart, pipeline conversion funnel with stage-to-stage rates
3. **sequence drag-drop builder** — @dnd-kit sortable, grip handles, insert-between-steps, visual connector lines, 3 step types (email/wait/condition)
4. **email template preview** — variable substitution ({{contact_name}} etc), desktop/mobile viewport toggle, sample lead data
5. **bulk email drafting** — modal: AI batch drafting with tone selection, per-lead review/edit, bulk send
6. **supabase migration 016** — stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id, usage_metrics table

### anivia lead gen rebuild — hallucination → real data pipeline
- old: asked AI to invent "real" companies (all fabricated)
- new 4-phase pipeline:
  1. brave web search for real companies matching criteria
  2. website scraping for emails, phones, descriptions
  3. estonian registry lookup (inforegister.ee) for EE companies
  4. email MX verification via DNS-over-HTTPS
  5. dedup against existing org leads
  6. AI scoring on REAL data only (0-100 based on ICP fit)
- no email found = lead dropped (zero fabrication)
- BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY added to .env.local
- tested: key works, returns real estonian companies (stragendo, estonian timber)

### remaining anivia blockers
- vercel pro upgrade ($20/mo) for 15-min cron cadence
- stripe API keys (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, price IDs, webhook secret)
- custom domain
- wire sequence-builder + bulk-email components into their pages
