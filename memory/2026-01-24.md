## Context Memory API
- Implemented advanced error recovery system with AI-powered strategy generation
- Created system health monitoring service
- Fixed vector dimension issues in database queries

## Clawdbot Health Dashboard
- Created new project: real-time system health monitoring dashboard
- Deployed to Vercel: https://clawdbot-health-dashboard.vercel.app/
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/Ronpiii/clawdbot-health-dashboard
- Implemented Pencil.dev design with dark theme:
  - Sidebar navigation
  - System ID card (hostname, platform, uptime, API endpoint)
  - CPU load average metrics (1/5/15 min)
  - Memory usage gauge with breakdown
  - Disk usage gauge with breakdown
  - Status badges and color-coded indicators
- Fixed disk parsing bug
- Local instance running on port 3000 for real server monitoring

## Notes
- Vercel deployment shows Vercel's container metrics, not actual server
- Local instance monitors real Clawdbot infrastructure
- Ron wants me to take ownership of projects rather than asking for direction

## TODO
- Consider adding historical data/charts
- Multi-host monitoring for enterprise tier
- Alerting system integration
