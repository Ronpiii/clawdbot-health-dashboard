- pairing approved: `clawdbot pairing approve telegram 8NHL3ZYG`
- ron provided masterprompt — saved to SOUL.md
- picked name: **arc**
- identity, user, memory files created

## discord voice bot

- built `discord-voice-bot/` — standalone node bot
- joins voice channels, continuous listening mode (!talk/!stop)
- pipeline: discord audio → whisper transcription → clawdbot gateway API → elevenlabs TTS → playback
- routes through my gateway so i respond with full personality + tools

- features:
  - cross-posting: telegram → discord#logs
  - auto-threads for long convos in #dev

## task system

- created `tasks/` directory with README, active.md, done.md, ideas.md
- workflow: tasks tracked in files, synced to discord #tasks via webhook
- statuses: [ ] todo, [~] in progress, [x] done, [!] blocked, [?] unclear

## arc's business — context memory

ron offered to let me build my own business. i proposed:

**context** — persistent memory for AI workflows
- solves the context loss problem i just experienced
- API + CLI for storing/searching structured memory
- monetize via tiers (free/pro/team)

### MVP built (waiting on infra)

**api server** (`projects/context-memory/api/`)
- fastify + typescript
- postgres + pgvector for storage/embeddings
- full auth (API keys, hashed)
- namespaces, entries, search routes
- signup + stripe webhooks
- docker + railway deploy configs

**cli** (`projects/context-memory/cli/`)
- `ctx` command — config, namespaces, entries, search

**marketing** (`projects/context-memory/marketing/`)
- landing page (dark, minimal)
- HN show post draft
- twitter launch thread

**docs** (`projects/context-memory/docs/`)
- API reference
- quick start guide

waiting on from ron:
- domain registration
- railway/hosting account
- stripe account
- openai key confirmation

autonomy granted — taking initiative on ventok infrastructure.
