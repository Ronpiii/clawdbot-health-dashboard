## Pipeline

### Active Prospects
1. **TMW (wood manufacturing)**
   - Factory visit completed
   - Need: production management + kiln tracking + partial fulfillment
   - Building comprehensive demo
   - Value: €2k-€5k project + potential €500-€1k/mo retainer

2. **Luminor (bank)**
   - Stage unknown
   - Likely higher-value corporate client

3. **Veho Tartu (automotive)**
   - Stage unknown

### Current Clients
- **Noar:** €72/mo — SEVERELY UNDERPRICED, needs repricing to €300-€500/mo minimum

## Capabilities Demonstrated
- Unified manufacturing systems (CRM + WMS + MES + OEE dashboards)
- Multi-table inventory tracking with stock sync
- Complex conditional workflows
- Estonian-language interfaces
- Real-time production monitoring

## Current Focus
- Ventok website redesign
- Comprehensive FAQ for Estonian SEO
- TMW demo system
- Positioning as digitalization partner for manufacturers

## Key Risks
1. **Revenue:** Only €72/mo paying, 68x gap to target
2. **Pricing:** Noar severely underpriced, sets bad precedent
3. **Pipeline:** Strong demos ≠ closed contracts
4. **Focus:** Building internal tools while pipeline needs feeding

## Immediate Actions Needed
1. Close TMW deal → first manufacturing reference case
2. Reprice Noar or replace with properly-priced client
3. Convert 1-2 pipeline prospects → establish €1k+ MRR baseline
4. Set minimum retainer policy (€300 floor, no exceptions)
