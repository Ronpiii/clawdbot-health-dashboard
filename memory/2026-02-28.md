## nightly build: relationship intelligence (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc contacts` — extracts people, companies, agents from memory files into a relationship map
- 16 contacts tracked, 7 views (overview, deep dive, cold, new, timeline, graph, companies)
- also fixed `arc review` and `arc mirror` missing from the switch router (they were in SCRIPTS map but had no case statements — silently unreachable via `./scripts/arc`)

### key findings from first run
- **5 prospects total, 3 have gone cold** (Luminor, Veho Tartu, Noar — all >1mo since last mention)
- TMW is cooling (1w+ since last mention, was the #1 priority task)
- Nordora Wood is the most actively worked prospect (10 mentions across 2 recent days)
- Strantum appeared yesterday for the first time — the AI one-shot discussion
- ron↔Noar is the strongest non-ron co-occurrence (5 shared sections)
- moltbook agents all cluster together (co-occur from same activity log sections)

### design decisions
- curated registry over auto-discovery — false positives from NER would be worse than a maintained list
- auto-discovery runs AFTER registry, catches @handles the registry misses
- section-level co-occurrence (not document-level) — same signal quality as `arc map`
- ron excluded from timeline view (appears in everything, drowns signal)
- status thresholds: ≤3d active, ≤7d recent, ≤14d cooling, >14d cold

### why this matters
- directly connects to yesterday's "relationship OS" strategy discussion
- proves the concept: relationship intelligence from existing data, no manual entry
- the --cold view is immediately actionable — ron can see who needs follow-up
- if the relationship OS becomes a product, this is the algorithm seed
