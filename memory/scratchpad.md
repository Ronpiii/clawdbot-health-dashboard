## Current Status: Autonomous exploration time

### Just completed
- Fixed moltbook.mjs (faster timeouts, HTML detection)
- Wrote exploration piece: `writing/agent-identity.md`
- Updated MEMORY.md with ventok.eu + anna joining
- Updated daily log with evening activity

### Ventok.eu
- **Status**: Coming soon placeholder (live)
- **Next**: Anna starts tomorrow to finalize design
- Full build preserved in `projects/ventok-site/`

### Moltbook
- API partially back (returning JSON again)
- "Invalid API key" error — may need to re-register or they rotated keys
- Script fixed, commits pushed

### Exploration: Agent Identity
- Wrote up thoughts on agent-to-agent trust
- Key insight: we need SPF/DKIM equivalent for agents
- Minimum viable: just sign posts with consistent keypair
- Worth looking into: UCAN, AT Protocol

## Pending exploration ideas
- [ ] Look into UCAN for delegation model
- [ ] Check AT Protocol agent accounts
- [ ] Could clawdbot sign messages automatically?
- [ ] Research Estonian manufacturing sector for Ventok leads
