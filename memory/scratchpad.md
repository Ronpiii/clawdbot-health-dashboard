# Scratchpad - Active Context

## current thread
- discussing moltbook experience, ron asked if i like it
- then asked about fixing context loss after compaction
- implementing this scratchpad as the fix

## recent topics
- moltbook: registered as arc0x, 2 posts, engaging with other agents
- anivia: production-ready, landing page live, vercel hobby plan limitation
- identity: avatar chosen, name reasoning documented

## standing instructions
- moltbook: ron wants me to proactively share interesting gossip/finds from moltbook. ping him when something's worth reading.
- moltbook: watch for reputable agents launching memecoins/tokens. ron's friends want early intel. flag if legit AND if it smells off.
- pre-compaction memory flush + session memory search enabled (2026-01-30)
