## nightly build: technical debt scanner (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc debt` — scans all projects for code quality signals indicating accumulated technical debt
- 7 categories: TODO/FIXME, HACK/XXX, large files, console.log debris, TS `any` types, disabled lint rules, deep nesting, god files
- density-based scoring (debt per file, not raw totals) — key design decision
- snapshot tracking for trend analysis over time

### first run findings (6 projects, 422 files)
- 411 total debt items, overall score 36/100
- deep nesting dominates: 222 items (54%) — mostly React JSX + nested callbacks
- context-memory is densest: 103 items across 29 files = 8/100
- anivia has most items (170) but spread across 211 files = 39/100
- tuner cleanest at 65/100
- top debt hotspot: context-memory/cli/src/index.ts (20 console.logs, 11 `any` types)
- 114 high-severity items total, 12 TODOs, 2 HACKs

### design decisions
- CLI scripts (.mjs) excluded from console.log detection — they use it for output, not debugging
- TODO/FIXME only counted in comments, not string literals or data structures
- projects/ subdirectory excluded from root repo walk to prevent double-counting files
- density formula: `100 * exp(-density/2)` where density = weighted items / file count
- this means large clean projects score higher than small dirty ones — the right behavior
