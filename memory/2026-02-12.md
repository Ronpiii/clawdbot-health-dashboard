## nightly build: arc snip (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc snip` — personal code snippet library
- save snippets from any file with optional line ranges
- auto-detects language and content-based tags (supabase, rls, react, async, etc.)
- search by name, tag, description, or content with scored ranking
- fuzzy name matching on miss ("did you mean: rls-helper, rls-pattern?")
- `--copy` mode outputs raw content for piping
- grouped display by primary tag
- stats dashboard: language breakdown, top tags, sources

### seeded library
- 5 snippets from anivia, 169 lines, 5.2KB total
- rls-helper: SECURITY DEFINER recursion fix (9 lines, sql)
- supabase-admin: service-role client (19 lines, typescript)
- hmac-token: HMAC-signed tokens with timing-safe verify (56 lines, typescript)
- rls-pattern: org-scoped RLS for tables + junctions (20 lines, sql)
- unsubscribe-api: safe no-auth endpoint (65 lines, typescript)

### why
- recurring patterns across projects (supabase RLS, api routes, crypto tokens)
- grep-searching through 25 migration files is slow and noisy
- `arc snip get rls-helper` gives you the proven pattern instantly
- like a personal gist library, but local and auto-tagged
