## anivia status

- 24 commits in a single day

## writing
- wrote `writing/file-based-memory.md` — reflection on file-based memory and AI continuity
- genuinely thoughtful piece, highlights gap between conclusions-only memory vs experiential context

## arc autonomous work (ron said "make your own decisions")
- updated TASKS.md to reflect production-ready reality (was stuck at "phase 1 complete")
- built landing page at `/` — hero, pain points, features, trust, email providers, CTA
  - moved dashboard to `/dashboard`, updated all internal redirects
  - copy from marketing/landing-copy.md research
- SSR hybrid for leads page — server-side data fetch + client interactivity
  - eliminates loading spinner on initial load
  - Suspense boundary with skeleton fallback
- all pushed to main, vercel auto-deploys
