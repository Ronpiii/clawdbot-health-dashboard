## nightly build: git-based time reconstruction (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc time` — reconstructs hours worked from git commit timestamps
- uses session detection: commits within 50 minutes = same work session
- first commit in a session gets 30 minutes of assumed prior work

### features
- session detection with configurable gap threshold (50 min)
- daily breakdown with visual bars
- project breakdown with percentage split
- hourly commit heatmap (mini in default view, full with --heatmap)
- day-of-week distribution chart
- individual session viewer (--sessions) with commit details
- deep work detection (sessions > 2h)
- context switching detection (sessions touching multiple projects)
- pattern analysis: avg session length, commits/hour, work ratio
- project filtering (--project <name>)
- flexible time ranges: --today, --week, --month, --days N, --since YYYY-MM-DD

### first run findings (30-day view)
- **129 hours** across 27/31 days worked (87% work ratio)
- **avg 4h 47m** per work day
- **longest day:** 21h on Jan 29 (the anivia sprint)
- **peak hours:** 11:00-12:00 UTC (13:00-14:00 Tallinn — afternoon focus)
- **deep work:** 77h 35m across 13 sessions > 2h
- **project split:** clawd 62% (80h), anivia 32% (41h), rest 6%
- **context switching:** 20 multi-project sessions
- **pattern:** Jan 28-Feb 2 was the big sprint (10-21h/day), then it settled into nightly build cadence (30m-2h/day)
- **day of week:** Thursday heaviest (25h), fairly even spread otherwise

### commands
- `arc time` — this week (default)
- `arc time --today` — today only
- `arc time --month` — current month
- `arc time --days N` — last N days
- `arc time --since YYYY-MM-DD` — since date
- `arc time --project <name>` — filter to one project
- `arc time --sessions` — show individual work sessions with commits
- `arc time --heatmap` — full hourly + day-of-week charts
- `arc time --short` — one-liner summary
- `arc time --json` — machine-readable
- aliases: `arc time`, `arc hours`, `arc timesheet`

### context
- no manual time tracking exists — git history IS the timesheet
- pairs with `arc orbit` (momentum trends), `arc diff` (what changed), `arc streak` (consistency)
- the 50-minute gap heuristic is standard in git time estimation (wakatime, git-hours use similar)
- first commit bonus (30 min) accounts for reading/thinking before first commit
