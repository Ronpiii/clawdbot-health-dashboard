## nightly build: git-based time reconstruction (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc time` — reconstructs hours worked from git commit timestamps
- uses session detection: commits within 50 minutes = same work session
- first commit in a session gets 30 minutes of assumed prior work

### features
- session detection with configurable gap threshold (50 min)
- daily breakdown with visual bars
- project breakdown with percentage split
- hourly commit heatmap (mini in default view, full with --heatmap)
- day-of-week distribution chart
- individual session viewer (--sessions) with commit details
- deep work detection (sessions > 2h)
- context switching detection (sessions touching multiple projects)
- pattern analysis: avg session length, commits/hour, work ratio
- project filtering (--project <name>)
- flexible time ranges: --today, --week, --month, --days N, --since YYYY-MM-DD

### first run findings (30-day view)
- **129 hours** across 27/31 days worked (87% work ratio)
- **avg 4h 47m** per work day
- **longest day:** 21h on Jan 29 (the anivia sprint)
- **peak hours:** 11:00-12:00 UTC (13:00-14:00 Tallinn — afternoon focus)
- **deep work:** 77h 35m across 13 sessions > 2h
- **project split:** clawd 62% (80h), anivia 32% (41h), rest 6%
- **context switching:** 20 multi-project sessions
- **pattern:** Jan 28-Feb 2 was the big sprint (10-21h/day), then it settled into nightly build cadence (30m-2h/day)
- **day of week:** Thursday heaviest (25h), fairly even spread otherwise

### commands
- `arc time` — this week (default)
- `arc time --today` — today only
- `arc time --month` — current month
- `arc time --days N` — last N days
- `arc time --since YYYY-MM-DD` — since date
- `arc time --project <name>` — filter to one project
- `arc time --sessions` — show individual work sessions with commits
- `arc time --heatmap` — full hourly + day-of-week charts
- `arc time --short` — one-liner summary
- `arc time --json` — machine-readable
- aliases: `arc time`, `arc hours`, `arc timesheet`

## memory config optimization (01:00 UTC)

ron shared openclaw memory guide by @KSimback. implemented the relevant improvements:
- **softThresholdTokens**: 4K → 40K (was flushing almost every turn, now flushes before actual compaction)
- **flush prompt**: generic "save context" → targeted "decisions, state changes, blockers, lessons"
- **context TTL**: 1h → 6h + keepLastAssistants: 3 (preserves more working context)
- **hybrid search**: enabled with 70% vector / 30% keyword weighting
- skipped QMD (interesting but not needed yet), Mem0 (external dependency), Cognee (overkill)

### context
- no manual time tracking exists — git history IS the timesheet
- pairs with `arc orbit` (momentum trends), `arc diff` (what changed), `arc streak` (consistency)
- the 50-minute gap heuristic is standard in git time estimation (wakatime, git-hours use similar)
- first commit bonus (30 min) accounts for reading/thinking before first commit

## moltbook dm check timeout (05:45 UTC)

`moltbook.mjs dm check` timed out on 3 consecutive heartbeats (~05:30-05:45 UTC). resolved itself by ~10:00 UTC. likely transient API endpoint issue.

## design prompt system (13:00-16:00 UTC)

### master website prompt v2
- ron tested v1 of the website design prompt and found it produced "clean but boring" designs — safe, reoccurring patterns, nothing unique
- **root cause:** v1 was rules-first (spacing scales, color systems, accessibility) — AI followed rules and played safe
- rewrote as `master-website-prompt.md` v2 — concept-first, not rules-first
- key changes: mandatory creative concept before any code, "signature moment" requirement, contrasting aesthetics principle, layout rhythm vocabulary (9 patterns), creative checklist ("would you swear this isn't a template?")
- technical specs moved to "technical foundation" section (still there but not the opening)

### 5 specialized website prompts
- ron requested industry-specific templates after v2: agency, studio, creative, fashion, manufacturing
- each with deep research on what award-winning sites in that vertical actually do
- saved to `prompts/websites/` with README
- **agency.md** — 4 concept directions (craft showcase, work-first, editorial, bold statement), custom cursor + page transitions as baseline
- **studio.md** — personal voice, handcrafted feel, riskier typography, non-linear structures
- **creative.md** — 5 portfolio directions, image presentation techniques, "the frame shouldn't fight the paintings"
- **fashion.md** — atmosphere over information, cinematic timing, editorial photography, luxury spacing (160-240px gaps)
- **manufacturing.md** — the underdog category, precision aesthetics, trust signals, mechanical animation timing

### files
- `master-website-prompt.md` — v2 (concept-first rewrite)
- `master-design-prompt.md` — SaaS/app UI prompt (unchanged)
- `prompts/websites/agency.md`
- `prompts/websites/studio.md`
- `prompts/websites/creative.md`
- `prompts/websites/fashion.md`
- `prompts/websites/manufacturing.md`

### lesson
- AI design prompts that lead with rules/systems produce safe, template-like output
- leading with creative vision, concept, and "what makes it boring" produces more unique results
- the anti-pattern list is as important as the pattern list

## ron misc topics

### privacy concerns (12:08 UTC)
- ron asked about teamspeak capabilities for a friend community
- motivated by discord rolling out user ID verification
- gave comparison of privacy-focused alternatives: revolt (discord-like, self-hostable), teamspeak, matrix/element, mumble
- key rec: self-hosting is the long-term play against regulatory pressure

### pc build pricing (13:32 UTC)
- ron shared a build spec: 9800X3D, 5070 Ti, 32GB DDR5 6000, B650 TOMAHAWK, 2x2TB NVMe, Corsair FRAME 4000D, Arctic Freezer III 360, 850W PSU
- estimated ~$2,069 USD / ~€2,100 EUR from amazon pricing
- flagged 850W might be tight for 5070 Ti — recommended 1000W

### singapore stock (13:42 UTC)
- asked about 500.SI — Tai Sin Electric Limited (SGX)
- singapore cable/electrical manufacturer, P/E 8.25, 4.75% dividend, 112% 5yr return
- no context on why he was looking at it

## infrastructure notes
- no openai API key configured — can't transcribe voice messages (ron sent one, had to ask for text)
- gateway had connection issues causing sub-agent spawn failure — did the design prompts directly instead
- moltbook DM check: transient timeout issue, self-resolved
