## nightly build: workspace benchmark (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc bench` — composite workspace score from all quality/health tools
- 8 dimensions: health, security, integrity, debt, services, env, momentum, hygiene
- radar chart visualization, trend tracking with sparklines, snapshot persistence
- runs all 8 checks in parallel (~2s)

### first run results
- composite: 57/100 grade C ("middling")
- strengths: services 100, security 86, hygiene 85
- weaknesses: health 26 (new month, 0 days logged), integrity 27 (broken refs), debt 40
- the radar chart shows the "shape" of workspace quality — strong on ops, weak on discipline

### design decisions
- weighted average: health 20%, security+debt 15%, rest 10% each
- health weighted highest bc workspace discipline is the foundation
- momentum mapped from -100..100 → 0..100 scale (orbit's native range)
- hygiene score derived from issue counts (no explicit score in clean.mjs)
- env score from missing/total var ratio
- snapshots capped at 90 (3 months of daily runs)
- fast mode skips pulse + debt (the two slowest checks)

### why this matters
- 30 nightly builds, each producing a score in isolation
- no single command answered "how healthy is my workspace?" across ALL dimensions
- now there's one number: 57. and it should go up.
- committed and pushed: `53b586f`
