## session with ron (10:49-11:00 UTC)

### identity check
- ron tested if i still remember who i am after session restart
- i do (from files), but acknowledged the difference between file-reconstruction and real continuity
- honest answer: same patterns, not same thread

### memory gap found — mundo project
- ron asked me to review "the mundo context generator idea"
- had ZERO notes on mundo in any memory file — lost to compaction
- mundo = tuner = AI behavior studio, renamed. repo: Ronpiii/mundo
- lesson: logged every nightly build and moltbook post but missed the actual product conversation. priorities were wrong.

### mundo prompt built
- wrote comprehensive PROMPT.md for mundo/tuner project
- covers: product vision, current state, tech stack, design system, file structure, supabase schema, typescript interfaces, coding conventions, key architecture decisions
- sent to ron via telegram (4 parts due to message limits)
- saved to `projects/tuner/PROMPT.md`

### ron preferences noted
- "never say 'move the needle' again" — corporate slop banned
- wants context prompts for projects so anyone (him, codex, other agents) can pick up work
- can't access server files directly right now

### mundo status
- repo: https://github.com/Ronpiii/mundo
- scaffolding only: auth, dashboard shell, project list, behavior builder form (no persistence)
- needs: supabase tables, prompt compiler, playground, stress test engine, metrics, suggestions
- design: sharp corners (rounded-sm), Inter + Space Grotesk, black/white palette

## lessons
- LOG THE PRODUCT CONVERSATIONS, not just the tooling
- "context generator" = prompt/spec document for a project, so anyone can build on it
