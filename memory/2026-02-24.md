## nightly build: file change hotspot analyzer (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc hotspots` — finds the most frequently modified files across all projects
- surfaces complexity risk (high changes + high churn), coupling patterns (co-change analysis), cold code (large untouched files)
- classic software engineering technique from "Your Code as a Crime Scene" — applied to personal workspace

### views
- **default**: top N hottest files with heat bars, heat zones by directory, complexity risk flags
- **--cold**: large code files with zero changes in period — dead code or stable foundations
- **--coupling**: co-change analysis — files that always change together with coupling strength %
- **--authors**: who touches what, focus areas by file category
- **--category**: changes grouped by type (component/source/config/docs/database/etc)
- **--short**: one-liner summary
- **--json**: machine-readable

### first run findings (30d, 7 repos)
- 672 files changed, 1,897 total changes across workspace
- hottest code file: sidebar.tsx (29x changes, 2 authors) — smells like it needs decomposition
- highest complexity risk: lead-generator.ts (21x changes, 2,360 lines churned)
- strongest coupling: icp-actions.ts ↔ icp-tab.tsx (67% co-change rate)
- heat zones: memory/ dominates (463 changes), then scripts/ (152), then anivia components
- 3 cold files: 990 lines total, led by discord-voice-bot/index.js (699 lines, 3mo untouched)
- 51 files touched by multiple contributors — merge conflict potential
- top 3 files account for significant % of all changes — high concentration

### design
- excludes lockfiles from hotspot ranking (noise)
- coupling analysis skips commits touching >20 files (bulk changes) and requires ≥3 co-changes
- complexity risk = changes × churn — flags files that are both frequently modified AND heavily rewritten
- cold file detection limited to code extensions (ts/tsx/js/jsx/css) with ≥50 lines

## discord-voice-bot removed (12:27 UTC)
- ron said "kill it" — removed broken submodule ref, 110 days stale, 699 lines untouched
- was flagged cold in hotspot analysis the same night — good timing
- committed: `remove discord-voice-bot — dead project, 110d stale`

## PDF design prompt for claude co-work (16:45 UTC)
- ron wanted a prompt to make claude co-work generate beautiful PDFs (default output was ugly)
- built a detailed design-first prompt: react-pdf stack, typography system, color palette, 7 components
- initially used Inter (sans), ron pushed back — switched to serif: Playfair Display headings + Source Serif 4 body
- delivered full updated prompt

## nordorawood proposal PDF review (18:04 UTC)
- ron sent a 5-page ventok proposal PDF for nordorawood.com (termopuit OÜ)
- content: website dev + SEO/SAE/GEO optimization, 3 packages (€2,200 / €3,800 / €5,800)
- design was actually solid: serif headings, navy+red accent palette, callout boxes, pricing cards with "SOOVITATUD" badge
- feedback: cover page too much dead space, recommended card could use more visual differentiation, footer contact section plain
- proposal dated 24 feb 2026, valid 30 days

## notes
- git push blocked all day — no github auth configured on this host
- brave API key still missing — reddit pulse/web search unavailable
