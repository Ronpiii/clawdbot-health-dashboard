## nightly build: file change hotspot analyzer (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc hotspots` — finds the most frequently modified files across all projects
- surfaces complexity risk (high changes + high churn), coupling patterns (co-change analysis), cold code (large untouched files)
- classic software engineering technique from "Your Code as a Crime Scene" — applied to personal workspace

### views
- **default**: top N hottest files with heat bars, heat zones by directory, complexity risk flags
- **--cold**: large code files with zero changes in period — dead code or stable foundations
- **--coupling**: co-change analysis — files that always change together with coupling strength %
- **--authors**: who touches what, focus areas by file category
- **--category**: changes grouped by type (component/source/config/docs/database/etc)
- **--short**: one-liner summary
- **--json**: machine-readable

### first run findings (30d, 7 repos)
- 672 files changed, 1,897 total changes across workspace
- hottest code file: sidebar.tsx (29x changes, 2 authors) — smells like it needs decomposition
- highest complexity risk: lead-generator.ts (21x changes, 2,360 lines churned)
- strongest coupling: icp-actions.ts ↔ icp-tab.tsx (67% co-change rate)
- heat zones: memory/ dominates (463 changes), then scripts/ (152), then anivia components
- 3 cold files: 990 lines total, led by discord-voice-bot/index.js (699 lines, 3mo untouched)
- 51 files touched by multiple contributors — merge conflict potential
- top 3 files account for significant % of all changes — high concentration

### design
- excludes lockfiles from hotspot ranking (noise)
- coupling analysis skips commits touching >20 files (bulk changes) and requires ≥3 co-changes
- complexity risk = changes × churn — flags files that are both frequently modified AND heavily rewritten
- cold file detection limited to code extensions (ts/tsx/js/jsx/css) with ≥50 lines
