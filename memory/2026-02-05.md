### arc health — workspace health dashboard
- `scripts/health.mjs` — unified health check across all workspace systems
- combines: memory coverage, git hygiene, task velocity, project activity
- **memory metrics:** days logged this month, coverage %, current streak, total logs
- **git metrics:** dirty repos, unpushed commits, stale repos (>14 days)
- **task metrics:** open/done/blocked counts, velocity (completion %)
- **project metrics:** active (≤7d), stale (>30d), recent activity list
- weighted overall score (0-100) with progress bars
- color-coded health levels: 💚 excellent (90+), 💛 good (70+), 🟠 fair (50+), 🔴 needs attention
- actionable recommendations based on detected issues
- flags: `--short` (one-liner), `--json` (machine-readable)
- registered as `arc health` in CLI
- first run found real issues: 4 dirty repos, 1 unpushed, 0 task velocity
- posted to discord #logs
