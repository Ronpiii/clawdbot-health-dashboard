# 2026-02-10

## nightly build: arc focus (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc focus` — project context switcher for resuming work
- list mode: all projects sorted by last activity, dirty/clean status
- focus mode: deep context dump — resume point, git, tasks, blockers, decisions, recent discussions
- aliases: mundo→tuner, cm→context-memory, etc.
- flags: `--short`, `--json`
- added routing in arc CLI

### why
- ron switches between 5+ projects daily
- "where was I?" is a real friction point when context-switching
- one command to pick up exactly where you left off

## morning standup (06:00 UTC / 08:00 tallinn)
- morning briefing posted to discord #logs
- anivia: 6 checked, 0 advanced — stable
- git: submodule changes in discord-voice-bot + projects/tuner (from yesterday's mundo work)
- open threads from yesterday:
  - mundo: desktop vs web decision pending (ron's call)
  - discord slash commands: architecture still open
- overnight: built `arc focus` — project context switcher

## mundo UI refactor (11:35-16:00 UTC)

### context
- ron sent zip of mundo scaffold (10 files) + 7 pencil/design-tool screenshots
- scaffold: Next.js components for dashboard, editor, playground, test suite, 4 modals
- good visual design — dark theme, vscode-inspired, conductor pattern for dashboard

### refactor completed
1. **layout.tsx** — removed broken `<head>`, switched to `next/font/google` for Inter + JetBrains Mono
2. **lucide-react** — replaced ALL lucide CSS font references (~40 icons) across 7 components with proper react components
3. **route-based navigation** — created MundoShell.tsx (client wrapper), converted from useState view switching to app router routes: `/mundo`, `/mundo/editor`, `/mundo/playground`, `/mundo/tests`
4. **empty states** — PlaygroundView + TestSuiteView both support `empty` prop
5. **empty persona view** — new component matching screenshot 6: setup wizard with numbered steps (add prompt → guardrails → run tests)
6. **test suite** — "critical failures" stat card now visually prominent (red bg/border)
7. **data model** — created `lib/types.ts` (Persona, TestRun, HealthScore, etc.) + `lib/mock-data.ts` with typed mock data
8. **MundoContext** — context provider so child views can access active persona
9. **TopBar** — now context-aware: shows route-based active states, adapts to persona status (hides deploy for drafts, shows score dynamically)
10. **Sidebar** — refactored to use typed Persona data, score colors/bars computed from data

### build status
- `next build` passes clean, zero errors
- all routes prerender: `/mundo`, `/mundo/editor`, `/mundo/playground`, `/mundo/tests`

### files: 15 total (7 rewritten, 4 created, 2 data files, 1 shell, 1 empty state)

### not done yet
- sidebar persona switching doesn't change route (buttons work, data updates)
- playground input not functional
- no supabase integration yet
- no navigation highlighting in sidebar based on route

## daily summary (20:00 UTC)
- posted to discord #logs
- big day: mundo UI refactor — 15 files, clean build, route-based nav working
- overnight: arc focus tool shipped
- open threads: desktop vs web decision, discord slash commands architecture
