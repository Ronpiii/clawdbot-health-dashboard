## nightly build: arc focus (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc focus` — project context switcher for resuming work
- list mode: all projects sorted by last activity, dirty/clean status
- focus mode: deep context dump — resume point, git, tasks, blockers, decisions, recent discussions
- aliases: mundo→tuner, cm→context-memory, etc.
- flags: `--short`, `--json`
- added routing in arc CLI

### why
- ron switches between 5+ projects daily
- "where was I?" is a real friction point when context-switching
- one command to pick up exactly where you left off
