## nightly build: arc diff (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc diff` — workspace changelog that answers "what changed since X?"
- scans all git repos for commits + diffstat, memory files for create/modify, tasks for completions
- per-repo breakdown: file categories (scripts/src/docs/config), commit previews, diff bars
- hourly activity heatmap when enough commits exist
- flags: `--hours N`, `--days N`, `--since DATE`, `--short`, `--json`
- aliases: `arc diff`, `arc changes`

### also fixed
- `arc shield` was unreachable via the arc wrapper (missing case in switch statement)
- added both `diff` and `shield` routing to arc CLI

### why
- ron has an AI building things overnight — needs one command to see what happened
- `arc diff` = the overnight changelog. wake up, run it, full picture.
- works for any timeframe: `--hours 4` for a break, `--days 7` for a week review

## morning heartbeat (06:00 UTC / 08:00 tallinn)
- all checks clean: anivia sequences stable, no moltbook DMs, no queue progress (agent unclaimed)
- brave API key missing again — can't do reddit pulse or curiosity drop web search
- need to re-add BRAVE_API_KEY to gateway config
- ron was sick yesterday, light check-in sent

## mundo session with ron (09:53-14:00 UTC)

### ron feeling better after sick day
- back online, ready to work on mundo

### mundo idea prompt
- ron asked for a fresh idea prompt for mundo UI rebuild
- wrote IDEA.md — comprehensive handoff doc (product + technical context)
- split into: what/who/problem/core loop (product) + stack/schema/design system/conventions (technical)
- saved to projects/tuner/IDEA.md, sent via telegram in 4 parts

### conductor UI inspiration
- ron shared screenshot of conductor-style UI (agent-conversation-with-actions pattern)
- looks like codex/claude code interface adapted for AI persona management
- gave feedback: keep conversational panel + inline actions, kill the file tree, replace with health panel
- proposed layout: persona sidebar (with scores) | conversation main | health panel right
- key insight: "conductor is an IDE with an agent. mundo should be an agent that shows structured data"

### tech stack discussion
- ron using a scaffolder tool, asked about frontend stack
- recommended Next.js + Tailwind (option 1) since existing repo already has it

### desktop vs web app question
- ron asked about desktop app feasibility
- laid out Tauri vs Electron vs web-first approaches
- main issue: Next.js is server-oriented, doesn't fit desktop cleanly
- if desktop-first, React + Vite is better foundation
- recommended web-first, Tauri wrapper later if needed
- waiting on ron's answer re: what's pulling him toward desktop

### pending from earlier
- discord slash commands discussion still open (ron chose slash commands, architecture question unanswered: extend voice bot vs separate service)
