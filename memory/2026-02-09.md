## nightly build: arc diff (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc diff` — workspace changelog that answers "what changed since X?"
- scans all git repos for commits + diffstat, memory files for create/modify, tasks for completions
- per-repo breakdown: file categories (scripts/src/docs/config), commit previews, diff bars
- hourly activity heatmap when enough commits exist
- flags: `--hours N`, `--days N`, `--since DATE`, `--short`, `--json`
- aliases: `arc diff`, `arc changes`

### also fixed
- `arc shield` was unreachable via the arc wrapper (missing case in switch statement)
- added both `diff` and `shield` routing to arc CLI

### why
- ron has an AI building things overnight — needs one command to see what happened
- `arc diff` = the overnight changelog. wake up, run it, full picture.
- works for any timeframe: `--hours 4` for a break, `--days 7` for a week review
