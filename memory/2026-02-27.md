## nightly build: cross-reference integrity checker (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc mirror` — scans workspace for broken references across all markdown files
- checks: file paths, scripts, arc commands, URLs (optional)
- 279 refs scanned across 160 files, found 14 structural issues

### key findings
- **HEARTBEAT.md references advance-sequences.mjs which doesn't exist** — anivia sequence advancement has been silently skipped every heartbeat. HIGH severity
- `projects/ventok-site/` referenced in jan 31 log — directory doesn't exist (project is `ventok` or `ventok-website`)
- 3 prompt files (agency.md, studio.md, creative.md) referenced in feb 20 log but missing from prompts/websites/
- `arc cl` and `arc achievements` mentioned in old logs — commands that were discussed but never built
- with --urls: github.com/Ronpiii/mundo returns 404 (repo renamed to tuner), entire ctxmem.dev domain is down

### design decisions
- workspace-level path filtering: only check paths starting with known dirs (scripts/, memory/, tasks/, etc.)
- source-relative paths (src/, app/, lib/) deliberately skipped — they're project-internal, not workspace refs
- arc commands must be in backticks to match — prevents prose false positives ("arc feel", "arc clearly")
- URLs scored at weight=1 (informational), structural issues at normal severity weights
- template refs (BOOTSTRAP.md, SKILL.md) auto-suppressed

### false positive journey
- first run: 186 broken refs — 90% false positives
- culprits: API routes as file paths, generic words as project names, prose as arc commands
- after tightening: 14 real findings. precision > recall for this tool
