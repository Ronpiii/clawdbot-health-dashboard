## nightly build: cross-reference integrity checker (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc mirror` — scans workspace for broken references across all markdown files
- checks: file paths, scripts, arc commands, URLs (optional)
- 279 refs scanned across 160 files, found 14 structural issues

### key findings
- **HEARTBEAT.md references advance-sequences.mjs which doesn't exist** — anivia sequence advancement has been silently skipped every heartbeat. HIGH severity
- `projects/ventok-site/` referenced in jan 31 log — directory doesn't exist (project is `ventok` or `ventok-website`)
- 3 prompt files (agency.md, studio.md, creative.md) referenced in feb 20 log but missing from prompts/websites/
- `arc cl` and `arc achievements` mentioned in old logs — commands that were discussed but never built
- with --urls: github.com/Ronpiii/mundo returns 404 (repo renamed to tuner), entire ctxmem.dev domain is down

### design decisions
- workspace-level path filtering: only check paths starting with known dirs (scripts/, memory/, tasks/, etc.)
- source-relative paths (src/, app/, lib/) deliberately skipped — they're project-internal, not workspace refs
- arc commands must be in backticks to match — prevents prose false positives ("arc feel", "arc clearly")
- URLs scored at weight=1 (informational), structural issues at normal severity weights
- template refs (BOOTSTRAP.md, SKILL.md) auto-suppressed

### false positive journey
- first run: 186 broken refs — 90% false positives
- culprits: API routes as file paths, generic words as project names, prose as arc commands
- after tightening: 14 real findings. precision > recall for this tool

## morning standup (06:00 UTC)
- morning.mjs hung on wttr.in fetch (no timeout on the fetch call) — posted briefing manually via webhook
- TODO: add AbortController timeout to getWeather() in morning.mjs
- yesterday was a heavy build day: arc review, arc mirror, ventok-website CMS, moltbook comeback
- key finding from arc mirror: HEARTBEAT.md references advance-sequences.mjs that doesn't exist — silent failure every heartbeat

## strategic conversation: anivia pivot & AI one-shot problem (16:12-16:40 UTC)

### context
- ron initiated a deep strategy discussion about anivia's future given claude's rapid capability growth
- triggered by real experience: asked claude to research Strantum, it found CEO phone, board emails, drafted tailored outreach — doing 80% of what anivia does in a single shot

### key insights
1. **claude one-shots lead gen + drafting + sending** — anivia's current value prop is mostly commoditized
2. **what claude CAN'T do:** persistent state across sessions, multi-prospect orchestration, inbox monitoring, deliverability infra, compliance
3. **but with cron/heartbeat claude closes more of the gap** — for <50 relationships, claude + cron + gmail is probably good enough
4. **the one-shot problem is universal** — every SaaS is at risk of AI absorbing its core function

### product concept discussed: relationship OS for small operators
- automatic capture from real channels (gmail, telegram)
- AI builds relationship context without manual entry
- daily brief: who needs attention, what's overdue, what's moving
- timeline per relationship: every interaction in one place
- compounds over time — moat is accumulated relationship intelligence
- NOT a CRM — no forms, no pipeline dragging, no dashboards to configure

### three paths identified
1. **make arc better** — gmail integration, i become the relationship tracker (solves ron's problem fast, not a product)
2. **memory layer for AI agents** — structured relationship DB behind MCP, any AI agent gets perfect relationship memory (infrastructure play, ties to context-memory-api vision)
3. **full product** — bet on scaling past 50 relationships, team features, UI (real SaaS, but back in one-shot risk zone)

### ventok workflow mapped
- FIND → REACH OUT → CONVERSATIONS → PROPOSE → CLOSE → DELIVER → MAINTAIN
- breakpoint: everything between reach out and close lives in ron's head + scattered emails
- no single view of prospect/client state, follow-ups depend on memory

### status
- conversation paused — ron taking the workflow to visualize / map out
- no decisions made yet on direction
- this could reshape what anivia becomes (or whether it continues as-is)
