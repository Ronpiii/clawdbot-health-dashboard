## nightly build: project comparison dashboard (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc compare` — side-by-side project comparison across every dimension
- analyzes 9 projects: LOC, languages, commits (7d/30d), velocity, churn, tasks, deps, disk, age, memory mentions
- answers "how do my projects stack up against each other?" — the relative view no other tool provides

### features
- **default view**: detailed cards per project — activity bar, size, langs, commits, churn, tasks, deps, mentions, age
- **short mode**: compact table — one line per project with key metrics
- **sort modes**: activity (weighted composite), size (LOC), commits (30d), tasks, age, velocity, churn
- **comparison summary**: superlatives (biggest/busiest/stalest/most tasks/heaviest deps/most churn), totals, focus suggestion
- **project filtering**: `arc compare anivia tuner` — compare specific projects only
- **activity scoring**: weighted formula (commits×10, memory mentions×5, tasks×3, dirty/unpushed +5 each)

### first run (9 projects)
- anivia: 40.5K LOC, 271 commits, 7 open tasks, activity score 653 — dominates
- ventok: only "recent" project (1 commit this week), 2.4K lines of churn
- discord-voice-bot: 110d stale, flagged red
- totals: 56.8K LOC, 487 files, 15.9MB across all projects
- focus suggestion: anivia needs attention (7 open tasks, 1 dirty file)

### design decisions
- activity score is weighted composite, not raw commits — memory mentions and open tasks matter too
- status thresholds: active (≤1d), recent (≤7d), idle (≤30d), stale (>30d)
- for projects under root git (projects/ subdirs), commits are scoped to that path using `-- <path>` filter
- comparison summary only shows superlatives that have nonzero values — no noise
