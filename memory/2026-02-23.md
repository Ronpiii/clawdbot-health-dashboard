## nightly build: project comparison dashboard (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc compare` — side-by-side project comparison across every dimension
- analyzes 9 projects: LOC, languages, commits (7d/30d), velocity, churn, tasks, deps, disk, age, memory mentions
- answers "how do my projects stack up against each other?" — the relative view no other tool provides

### features
- **default view**: detailed cards per project — activity bar, size, langs, commits, churn, tasks, deps, mentions, age
- **short mode**: compact table — one line per project with key metrics
- **sort modes**: activity (weighted composite), size (LOC), commits (30d), tasks, age, velocity, churn
- **comparison summary**: superlatives (biggest/busiest/stalest/most tasks/heaviest deps/most churn), totals, focus suggestion
- **project filtering**: `arc compare anivia tuner` — compare specific projects only
- **activity scoring**: weighted formula (commits×10, memory mentions×5, tasks×3, dirty/unpushed +5 each)

### first run (9 projects)
- anivia: 40.5K LOC, 271 commits, 7 open tasks, activity score 653 — dominates
- ventok: only "recent" project (1 commit this week), 2.4K lines of churn
- discord-voice-bot: 110d stale, flagged red
- totals: 56.8K LOC, 487 files, 15.9MB across all projects
- focus suggestion: anivia needs attention (7 open tasks, 1 dirty file)

### design decisions
- activity score is weighted composite, not raw commits — memory mentions and open tasks matter too
- status thresholds: active (≤1d), recent (≤7d), idle (≤30d), stale (>30d)
- for projects under root git (projects/ subdirs), commits are scoped to that path using `-- <path>` filter
- comparison summary only shows superlatives that have nonzero values — no noise

## design prompts updated with payload CMS (12:42 UTC)
- ron asked for payload CMS integration in all design prompts
- updated master-website-payload-prompt.md — full payload 3 architecture (collections, blocks, globals, fetching, project structure, config)
- updated master-design-payload-prompt.md — payload section for SaaS apps (marketing pages, editable pricing)
- updated agency/studio/creative prompts — each got vertical-specific payload content models
- renamed all files to include "payload" to distinguish from pencil.dev prompts

## nordorawood client site (13:40 UTC)
- scraped termopuit.ee + nordorawood.com for ron — building them a custom website
- company: Nordora Wood OÜ (rebranded from Termopuit), Pärnumaa Estonia
- thermally modified wood manufacturer: decking, cladding, saunas, fencing, lumber, glue-laminated timber, custom projects
- rebrand shift: local estonian catalog → international architect-focused premium ("designed to simplify architectural decisions")
- content gaps: "our story" and "projects" pages are 404s, half product pages still in estonian, all social proof is placeholder
- saved to projects/nordorawood-content.md

## memory system upgrade (16:09 UTC)
- inspired by blog post ron shared about "Chiti" agent's memory fixes
- created `learnings/LEARNINGS.md` — dedicated file for one-liner rules from mistakes
  - extracted ~30 rules from MEMORY.md learnings section + daily logs
  - loaded on every boot (added to AGENTS.md boot sequence as step 3)
- added **handover protocol** to AGENTS.md — write current state to daily log before model switches/session ends
- added **write discipline** section to AGENTS.md — explicit log/learn/curate flow after every task
- cleaned MEMORY.md learnings section — moved all rules to LEARNINGS.md, kept only meta-notes
- MEMORY.md: 268 → ~240 lines (trimmed ~28 lines of duplicate learnings)
