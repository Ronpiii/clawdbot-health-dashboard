## nightly build (00:00 UTC)

### arc wins — accomplishment tracker
- `scripts/wins.mjs` — extracts completed work from daily memory logs
- detects: feature headers (`### name — desc`), bold bullets (`**feature** — desc`), task codes (ERR-1, PERF-2), checked items
- categorizes by type: feature ✨, fix 🔧, ship 🚀, improve ⚡, docs 📝, test 🧪
- auto-detects project from content (anivia, collabo, arc, etc.)
- importance ranking (high/medium/low) based on extraction source
- deduplicates similar wins to avoid noise
- flags: `--week`, `--project`, `--json`, `--verbose`
- stats section shows totals by project and type
- motivational closers: "small wins compound", "ship it", etc.
- tested on last 7 days: found 80 wins (54 collabo, 10 anivia, 7 arc)
- registered as `arc wins` / `arc achievements` in CLI
- posted to discord #logs

## anivia workflow redesign (00:50-02:00 UTC)

### ron greenlit anivia UX redesign
- discussed workflow friction: too many hops (leads → sequences → campaigns → approval → inbox → pipeline)
- proposed simplification: just two core views (Prospects + Sequences)
- ron approved autonomous work, will review in morning

### unified prospects view — feature/prospects-view branch
- **new /prospects route** — single view combining leads + sequences + actions
- **ProspectData** — aggregates lead info, active enrollment, pending AI actions, email history
- **expandable cards** — click to see conversation thread + pending actions inline
- **action buttons** — approve / reject / schedule per action, right in context
- **filter tabs**: all | needs attention | waiting | replied | meeting booked
- **batch approve** — approve all pending actions in one click
- **stage management** — move lead to stage from within the card
- **keyboard navigation**:
  - J/K to navigate between prospects
  - Enter/Space to expand/collapse
  - A to approve all actions on focused prospect
  - 1-5 to switch tabs
  - visual focus ring for accessibility
- builds on feature branch, old routes stay intact for safe rollback
- 2 commits pushed (37cd99f, fc346f3)

## anivia bugfixes (12:05-12:50 UTC)

### campaign sequences not showing — RLS debugging session
- user reported "sequence already in campaign" error but sequences showing 0
- **root cause:** user.id in `users` table didn't match auth.users.id
  - users table had: `ebeebb5c-a96b-...`
  - auth.users had: `ebeebb5c-a90b-...`
  - one character difference (`96b` vs `90b`) broke all RLS policies
- **secondary issue:** getCampaign queried non-existent columns (`enrolled_count`, etc.)
  - sequences table doesn't have count columns
  - fixed by computing counts from sequence_enrollments table
- **fixes pushed:**
  - c647035: nav remove sequences from sidebar
  - 50f4657: fix getCampaign enrollment counts
  - 5041db0: fix getCampaigns enrollment counts

### nav simplification
- removed Prospects from sidebar (accessed via campaigns)
- removed Sequences from sidebar (accessed via campaigns)
- final nav: Dashboard → Pipeline → Leads → Campaigns → Analytics
- back link from sequence detail now goes to /campaigns not /sequences

### custom sequence step icons
- created `src/components/sequences/icons.tsx` with anivia-style icons
- EmailStepIcon: minimal angular envelope
- WaitStepIcon: hourglass/timer
- ConditionStepIcon: decision diamond
- stroke-based, 1.5pt weight, rounded caps (matches landing page icons)

## codex integration test (13:15-13:45 UTC)

### ron tested codex CLI locally
- built bore tunnel project from SPEC.md
- discussed codex vs opus 4.5 tradeoffs:
  - codex: faster code gen, good for parallel grunt work
  - opus: stronger reasoning, better for debugging/architecture
- attempted to spawn codex from arc but not installed on server
- coding-agent skill exists and works, just needs codex CLI installed

## tuner project research (16:20-16:30 UTC)

### ron pitched AI behavior studio SaaS
- concept: build + stress test + measure AI personas
- gap: no consumer-friendly tool combining all three

### created full spec at projects/tuner/SPEC.md
- behavior builder (structured: identity, voice, knowledge, boundaries)
- auto stress tester (jailbreaks, edge cases, consistency, drift)
- metrics dashboard (accuracy, consistency, safety scores)
- fix suggestions (AI recommends changes, one-click apply)
- anivia design system (clean/minimal/geometric)
- 4-6 week MVP scope

### deep research at projects/tuner/RESEARCH.md
- scraped r/OpenAI, r/PromptEngineering, r/ChatGPT, r/SaaS, r/LocalLLaMA
- key findings:
  - users hate OpenAI's model deprecation instability
  - prompt engineering is "witchcraft" — people vibe-test
  - AI personality design has measurable uncanny valley
  - missing context is major failure mode
  - power users building complex multi-section prompts manually
- confirmed gaps: no auto-generated stress tests, no consistency scoring, no non-technical UX
- target personas: agency builders, support teams, solopreneurs, internal tools
- marketing angles: fear of embarrassment, control, trust
