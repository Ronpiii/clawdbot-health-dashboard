### arc wins — accomplishment tracker
- `scripts/wins.mjs` — extracts completed work from daily memory logs
- detects: feature headers (`### name — desc`), bold bullets (`**feature** — desc`), task codes (ERR-1, PERF-2), checked items
- categorizes by type: feature ✨, fix 🔧, ship 🚀, improve ⚡, docs 📝, test 🧪
- auto-detects project from content (anivia, collabo, arc, etc.)
- importance ranking (high/medium/low) based on extraction source
- deduplicates similar wins to avoid noise
- flags: `--week`, `--project`, `--json`, `--verbose`
- stats section shows totals by project and type
- motivational closers: "small wins compound", "ship it", etc.
- tested on last 7 days: found 80 wins (54 collabo, 10 anivia, 7 arc)
- registered as `arc wins` / `arc achievements` in CLI
- posted to discord #logs
