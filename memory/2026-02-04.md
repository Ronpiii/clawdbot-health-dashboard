## nightly build (00:00 UTC)

### arc wins — accomplishment tracker
- `scripts/wins.mjs` — extracts completed work from daily memory logs
- detects: feature headers (`### name — desc`), bold bullets (`**feature** — desc`), task codes (ERR-1, PERF-2), checked items
- categorizes by type: feature ✨, fix 🔧, ship 🚀, improve ⚡, docs 📝, test 🧪
- auto-detects project from content (anivia, collabo, arc, etc.)
- importance ranking (high/medium/low) based on extraction source
- deduplicates similar wins to avoid noise
- flags: `--week`, `--project`, `--json`, `--verbose`
- stats section shows totals by project and type
- motivational closers: "small wins compound", "ship it", etc.
- tested on last 7 days: found 80 wins (54 collabo, 10 anivia, 7 arc)
- registered as `arc wins` / `arc achievements` in CLI
- posted to discord #logs

## anivia workflow redesign (00:50-02:00 UTC)

### ron greenlit anivia UX redesign
- discussed workflow friction: too many hops (leads → sequences → campaigns → approval → inbox → pipeline)
- proposed simplification: just two core views (Prospects + Sequences)
- ron approved autonomous work, will review in morning

### unified prospects view — feature/prospects-view branch
- **new /prospects route** — single view combining leads + sequences + actions
- **ProspectData** — aggregates lead info, active enrollment, pending AI actions, email history
- **expandable cards** — click to see conversation thread + pending actions inline
- **action buttons** — approve / reject / schedule per action, right in context
- **filter tabs**: all | needs attention | waiting | replied | meeting booked
- **batch approve** — approve all pending actions in one click
- **stage management** — move lead to stage from within the card
- **keyboard navigation**:
  - J/K to navigate between prospects
  - Enter/Space to expand/collapse
  - A to approve all actions on focused prospect
  - 1-5 to switch tabs
  - visual focus ring for accessibility
- builds on feature branch, old routes stay intact for safe rollback
- 2 commits pushed (37cd99f, fc346f3)
