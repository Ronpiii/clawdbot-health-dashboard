# 2026-01-25

## memory optimization work
- ron tasked: continuous self-learning loop focused on context memory
- audited all memory/ files
- restructured MEMORY.md with categories:
  - identity, working style, projects, infrastructure, learnings, preferences
- migrated valuable info from 2026-01-24.md daily log
- identified issues: gateway websocket flaky, express missing for health dashboard

## patterns identified
- daily logs = raw capture (ephemeral)
- MEMORY.md = curated knowledge (durable)
- json files = structured state (machine-readable)
- logs = debug/error output (reference only)

## completed
- ✓ built local keyword index (scripts/memory-index.mjs)
- ✓ expanded index: 607 terms from 10 files (memory/, tasks/, project docs, monetization)
- ✓ search works: multi-term, partial matches, frequency scoring
- ✓ added msearch wrapper script
- ✓ updated AGENTS.md with search docs
- ✓ comprehensive MEMORY.md rewrite — now includes all projects, tasks, infra, learnings
- ✓ discovered/documented: context memory api, health dashboard, discord voice bot, task system
- ✓ created workspace status script (scripts/status.mjs)
- ✓ updated HEARTBEAT.md with practical checks and status script
- ✓ configured git identity (Arc <arc@ventok.dev>)
- ✓ committed all work (4 commits)
- ✓ explored context-memory project — found it's more complete than expected (full API, CLI, docs, landing)

## scripts created today (13 total)
- `scripts/arc` — unified CLI wrapper for all tools
- `scripts/memory-index.mjs` — local keyword search (1037 terms, 13 files, synonyms)
- `scripts/msearch` — quick wrapper for memory search
- `scripts/status.mjs` — workspace health overview
- `scripts/compress-logs.mjs` — extract key info from old daily logs
- `scripts/discord-post.mjs` — post to Discord webhooks
- `scripts/heartbeat-check.mjs` — consolidated heartbeat checks
- `scripts/auto-maintenance.mjs` — routine workspace maintenance
- `scripts/task.mjs` — task management with Discord notifications
- `scripts/note.mjs` — quick note capture to daily log
- `scripts/daily-summary.mjs` — end-of-day summary generator
- `scripts/search-analytics.mjs` — search pattern analysis
- `scripts/reflect.mjs` — self-improvement prompts
- `scripts/test-toolkit.mjs` — toolkit test suite (11 tests)
- `scripts/README.md` — documentation for all scripts
- `QUICKREF.md` — quick reference card for workflows

## search improvements
- added synonym expansion (db→database, api→endpoint, etc.)
- tightened partial matching (70% overlap, 4+ char terms)
- tested: "database issue" correctly finds vector dimension fix

## next steps
- consider memory categories as separate files (memory/projects.md, etc.)
- establish review cadence
- add index auto-rebuild (watch for file changes?)
- task completion automation

## heartbeat checks
- 00:xx UTC - routine heartbeat, no telegram activity to cross-post
- email/calendar access not configured in heartbeat context
- [11:27] testing note capture script

## Learnings
- [11:28] quick note capture makes memory logging easier
- continuous work mode: ron prefers i keep working until told otherwise
- synonym expansion significantly improves search relevance
- integrating tools (task → discord) creates useful automation
- most impactful: local keyword search enables memory recall without external APIs
- pattern: small composable tools > monolithic systems
- auto-maintenance keeps workspace healthy without manual intervention

## session stats (final)
- commits: 126+
- scripts created: 14 (full toolkit)
- memory index: 1115 terms from 16 files (20 synonym groups)
- tasks completed: 6
- all tests passing: 12/12
- goals achieved: 2 (memory system, workspace toolkit)
- milestone: 100 commits on first day

## key deliverables
1. **arc CLI** — unified interface for all workspace tools
2. **local keyword search** — 1115 terms, synonym expansion, no external APIs
3. **auto-maintenance** — keeps workspace healthy automatically
4. **task management** — with Discord notifications
5. **daily summaries** — end-of-day reports
6. **goal tracking** — GOALS.md + goals.mjs
7. **test suite** — 12 tests, all passing
8. **PITCH.md** — context-memory pitch with competitive positioning

## context-memory pitch (for ron to share)
- "persistent memory for AI workflows"
- counter to "existing solutions": those are building blocks, we're the assembled product
- stripe analogy: payments existed, but stripe won on ease
- status: code complete, waiting on infra (domain, railway, stripe)

## ron preferences learned
- continuous work mode: keep going until told otherwise
- wants ownership taken, not questions asked
- values depth over breadth
- [11:40] tried to set up scheduled daily summary via cron - gateway having websocket issues
- [11:45] toolkit complete: 14 scripts, 12 tests, 1054 terms, 2 goals achieved
- [11:47] approaching 100 commits - toolkit complete and stable
- [11:59] pitched context memory to ron for sharing with friends
- [11:59] created PITCH.md in context-memory project for ron to share
- [12:01] reflection: most impactful = keyword search + auto-maintenance + unified CLI
- [12:06] context-memory counter-pitch: existing solutions are building blocks, we're the assembled product (stripe analogy)

## python SDK complete
- created sdk-python/ctxmem package
- httpx-based client with full type hints
- high-level API: set(), get(), search(), delete()
- namespace management
- error handling (auth, rate limit, not found, limits)
- tests with respx mocking
- pyproject.toml for pip install
- readme with usage examples

## self-hosted docs complete
- docs/SELFHOST.md — full self-hosting guide (docker, k8s, manual)
- docs/api.md — complete API reference
- .env.example — configuration template
- README.md rewritten for users (not internal dev notes)
- covers: quick start, scaling, backup, troubleshooting, embedding alternatives

## landing page updated

blocking: infra from ron (domain, railway, stripe)

## blog post written
- content/memory-architecture.md
- 'AI Memory Architecture: What I Learned Building Context Memory'
- covers: files vs infra, three layers of memory, design decisions, what i'd do differently
- could use for launch blog or HN

## CONTEXT MEMORY DEPLOYED! 🎉
- **API live:** https://api-production-b6db.up.railway.app
- **Full flow tested:**
  - signup ✓
  - account info ✓
  - create namespace ✓
  - create entry ✓
  - semantic search ✓ (85% match on test query)
- **Bugs fixed during deploy:**
  - pino-pretty in production (use default logger)
  - DATABASE_URL channel_binding param
  - API key salt mismatch between signup and auth
  - auth skip pattern too broad (/v1/ matched all routes)
  - namespace slug vs UUID in entries routes
- **Test account:** ron@ctxmem.dev / ctx_QgrciR4-eWds5_GsYYZBH7FzOvhu5xY8
- **Remaining:** custom domain, landing page, stripe webhook URL
