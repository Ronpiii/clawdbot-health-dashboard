## memory optimization work
- ron tasked: continuous self-learning loop focused on context memory
- audited all memory/ files
- restructured MEMORY.md with categories:
  - identity, working style, projects, infrastructure, learnings, preferences
- migrated valuable info from 2026-01-24.md daily log
- identified issues: gateway websocket flaky, express missing for health dashboard

## patterns identified
- daily logs = raw capture (ephemeral)
- MEMORY.md = curated knowledge (durable)
- json files = structured state (machine-readable)
- logs = debug/error output (reference only)

## completed
- ✓ built local keyword index (scripts/memory-index.mjs)
- ✓ expanded index: 607 terms from 10 files (memory/, tasks/, project docs, monetization)
- ✓ search works: multi-term, partial matches, frequency scoring
- ✓ added msearch wrapper script
- ✓ updated AGENTS.md with search docs
- ✓ comprehensive MEMORY.md rewrite — now includes all projects, tasks, infra, learnings
- ✓ discovered/documented: context memory api, health dashboard, discord voice bot, task system
- ✓ created workspace status script (scripts/status.mjs)
- ✓ updated HEARTBEAT.md with practical checks and status script
- ✓ configured git identity (Arc <arc@ventok.dev>)
- ✓ committed all work (4 commits)
- ✓ explored context-memory project — found it's more complete than expected (full API, CLI, docs, landing)

## scripts created today
- `scripts/arc` — unified CLI wrapper for all tools
- `scripts/memory-index.mjs` — local keyword search (673 terms, synonym expansion)
- `scripts/msearch` — quick wrapper for memory search
- `scripts/status.mjs` — workspace health overview
- `scripts/compress-logs.mjs` — extract key info from old daily logs
- `scripts/discord-post.mjs` — post to Discord webhooks
- `scripts/heartbeat-check.mjs` — consolidated heartbeat checks
- `scripts/task.mjs` — task management with Discord notifications
- `scripts/note.mjs` — quick note capture to daily log
- `scripts/daily-summary.mjs` — end-of-day summary generator
- `scripts/README.md` — documentation for all scripts

## search improvements
- added synonym expansion (db→database, api→endpoint, etc.)
- tightened partial matching (70% overlap, 4+ char terms)
- tested: "database issue" correctly finds vector dimension fix

## next steps
- consider memory categories as separate files (memory/projects.md, etc.)
- establish review cadence
- add index auto-rebuild (watch for file changes?)
- task completion automation

## heartbeat checks
- 00:xx UTC - routine heartbeat, no telegram activity to cross-post
- email/calendar access not configured in heartbeat context
- [11:27] testing note capture script

## Learnings
- [11:28] quick note capture makes memory logging easier
- continuous work mode: ron prefers i keep working until told otherwise
- synonym expansion significantly improves search relevance
- integrating tools (task → discord) creates useful automation
