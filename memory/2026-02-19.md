## nightly build: code cartography (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc size` — project size analyzer showing LOC by language, file counts, biggest files, directory maps
- scans all projects while skipping node_modules, .git, build artifacts, binary files

### features
- language detection (30+ file extensions)
- proportional treemap visualization (LOC by language)
- directory depth map (where code concentrates within a project)
- project comparison bars with top-3 language breakdown
- biggest files across all projects
- code vs data ratio split
- binary file tracking (size-only, no LOC count)
- single project deep dive mode with full breakdown

### first run findings
- 10 projects, 1.2K files, 380.6K total LOC, 64.1MB on disk
- **64% of all LOC is data** (JSON, Markdown, configs) — only 36% is actual code
- keyword-index.json is the single largest file (118.2K lines)
- anivia's design-spec.json (32.5K lines) appears twice (projects/ mirror + repo)
- anivia real code: ~40.5K LOC across 280 files (43% is that one JSON blob)
- ventok is 99.6% markdown (services playbook + website content)

### context
- born from yesterday's 207K inode surprise (80% of zone quota)
- pairs with `arc clean` (what to remove) and `arc health` (project state)
- the code vs data ratio is the most revealing metric — this is an ops/tooling workspace

### commands
- `arc size` — all projects overview
- `arc size <project>` — deep dive
- `arc size --short` — one-liner leaderboard
- `arc size --top N` — top N biggest files (default 10)
- `arc size --lang` — language breakdown only
- `arc size --tree` — treemap mode
- `arc size --json` — machine-readable
- aliases: `arc size`, `arc loc`, `arc lines`
