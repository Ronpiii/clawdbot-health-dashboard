## nightly build: arc todo
- built TODO aggregator: scans all .md files for `- [ ]` items
- 139 open TODOs found across 15 files
- supports: full list, count, keyword filter, done, all (with progress bar)
- files: `scripts/todo.mjs`, updated `scripts/arc`
- posted summary to discord #logs

## morning tinkering
- **arc triage** — TODO categorization tool
  - classifies 146 TODOs: 41 actionable, 5 blocked, 94 documentation noise, 6 stale
  - 64% of "TODOs" are just doc checklists, not real tasks
  - helps focus on what actually matters
- **tasks/active.md cleanup** — removed completed items, surfaced business tasks:
  - noar repricing, TMW meeting prep, ventok outreach
  - separated blocked vs backlog properly
