## session with ron

### trading research
- ron asked about hummingbot + hyperliquid market making
- researched funding rate arbitrage strategies
- wrote comprehensive analysis: `research/hummingbot-hyperliquid-strategy.md`
- wrote pros/cons breakdown: `research/funding-arb-pros-cons.md`
- key finding: funding rate arb between hyperliquid + dydx (both no-KYC) is most viable
- ron can't use binance (KYC issues)
- alternative: hyperliquid spot-perp basis trade (single exchange)
- installed whisper for audio transcription (7GB venv at ~/whisper-env)

### ventok business
- ron shared full ventok business analysis
- saved to `memory/ventok-business.md`
- current state: €72/mo MRR (1 client: Noar, severely underpriced)
- target: €5k MRR for full-time transition
- team: Ronald (tech/automation) + Ellie (web design)
- pipeline: TMW (wood mfr, meeting in 2 weeks), Luminor (bank), Veho Tartu

### ventok lead generation
- created `projects/ventok/leads.csv` — 14 Estonian manufacturers
- prioritized: HIGH (Thermory, Timbeco, Saku Metall), MEDIUM (5), LOW (6)
- created `projects/ventok/outreach-sequence.md` — 3-email sequence in Estonian
- created `projects/ventok/lead-research-guide.md` — how to find more leads
- enriched top leads with contact info where available

### ellie onboarded
- approved ellie's telegram access (user id: 8143429523)
- she's ron's business partner handling web design at ventok

### security check
- ron flagged twitter posts about 923 exposed clawdbot gateways on shodan
- checked our config: `bind: "loopback"` ✓ (safe)
- vulnerable instances have `bind: "all"` exposing port 18789 with no auth

## todo for ron
- [ ] TMW meeting in 2 weeks — proposal ready?
- [ ] noar repricing conversation (€72 → €300-500/mo)
- [ ] context memory: domain, railway custom domain, stripe webhook

## notes
- ron prefers continuous work mode
- ellie is now in the loop on telegram
- ventok targeting estonian SME manufacturers escaping "excel hell"

## afternoon session: ventok AI sales system

### opsec discussion
- ron concerned after shodan exposure (923 clawdbot gateways exposed)
- our config: `bind: "loopback"` + `auth.mode: "token"` — safe
- tightened practices: no printing secrets, redact by default, assume logs persist

### TMW pivot
- TMW's main problem: B2B sales for foreign market expansion
- shifted from production tracking to sales system focus
- designed full-stack AI-managed system: lead → nurture → close → production

### AI sales system design
- created `projects/ventok/products/ai-sales-automation.md` — full spec
- created `projects/ventok/products/competitor-analysis.md` — market research

### competitor research
- analyzed: Clay, Instantly, Apollo, Lemlist, 11x, Artisan, Attio, Regie, Sera
- key finding: no one owns full funnel (outreach OR CRM, never both)
- gap: AI-native SMB tool for €300-800/mo (between cheap email tools and enterprise AI)
- local competitor Sera = outreach only, managed service, no self-serve

### product direction
- "dogfooding" approach: build system, use it for Ventok's own sales first
- AI finds Estonian manufacturers → sells Ventok services
- same system becomes SaaS product for TMW and others
- positioning: "The AI sales team for manufacturers"

### key design decisions
- AI as pilot, human approves
- confidence scores on actions
- approval queue workflow
- full funnel: research → outreach → nurture → close → production handoff
- manufacturing-specific features (production integration)
