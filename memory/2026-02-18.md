## ventok strategy session (10:21-12:20 UTC)

### proofreader AI idea
- ron had idea at work: AI tool that screenshots a URL, checks for language/localization mistakes, visual inconsistencies, gives SEO/accessibility/GEO scores
- target: agencies auditing client sites
- gave him a pencil.dev prompt for it
- saved for later — not building now, but solid product concept

### server housekeeping
- checked inode usage: 207K files, 80% of Zone's per-user quota
- top hogs: anivia (41K files) + tuner (29K) = node_modules
- listed all projects for ron — removed ventok-site project (being rebuilt from scratch)
- coming soon page on ventok.eu left untouched (served from Zone htdocs)

### ventok services playbook + website content
- ron shared two major docs he wrote:
  1. **services-playbook.md** (~50K words) — full tier-based service architecture
     - tier 1: business infrastructure, web design, process automation
     - tier 2: AI-augmented workflows, context-crafted agents
     - tier 3: local AI hosting, SaaS products
     - flywheel model, pricing framework, risk map, revenue projections
     - year 3 target: €5K MRR for full-time transition
  2. **website-content-en-et.md** — full bilingual EN/ET content for ventok.eu rebuild
     - new positioning: "build the backbone. then make it think."
     - 5 service pages, about, book a call, FAQs
     - reliability framework as key differentiator
- saved both to projects/ventok/
- suggested research topics for notebookLM: process mapping, change management, prompt engineering, RAG architecture, EIS grants

### design workflow
- master-design-prompt.md (from yesterday's research) working great in claude code
- ron's workflow: pencil.dev for exploration → claude code for implementation
- pencil's core problem: design→code translation loses fidelity
- claude code with master prompt skips that — code IS the source of truth

### notebookLM interests
- ron wants to deepen knowledge via notebookLM
- mapped his interest areas from our conversations (design, sales automation, AI agents, SaaS, GEO)
- recommended top 5: process mapping, change management, prompt engineering, RAG, estonian digitalization

## nightly build: color palette auditor (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc colors` — color palette auditor and generator
- scans all project globals.css files, extracts colors (oklch/hsl/hex), validates WCAG contrast
- generates monochrome-first palettes with optional accent colors

### features
- oklch→sRGB color math (conversion, luminance, contrast ratio)
- achromatic vs chromatic split with gray scale ramp visualization
- terminal 24-bit ANSI color swatches
- contrast pair validation against WCAG AA/AAA standards
- auto-detects additional contrast pairs from naming patterns
- monochrome score (% achromatic non-chart colors)
- palette health score (weighted: 40% monochrome + 60% contrast)
- palette generator: monochrome-first light+dark mode, 14 named accent hues
- copy-paste CSS output in oklch format

### first run
- anivia: 89/100 (94% mono, 77 colors, 1 sidebar-accent contrast fail)
- tuner: 88/100 (89% mono, 38 colors, muted text AA-lg only)
- collabo-v2: 80/100 (50% mono, but 100% contrast on detected pairs)
- ventok-site: 28/100 (custom naming = fewer detected pairs)

### context
- directly follows ron's design research deep dive (2026-02-17)
- ron strongly prefers monochrome-first, hated pencil.dev's AI colors
- this tool enforces those design principles with measurable scores
- generates compliant palettes on demand (`arc colors --generate --accent blue`)

### commands
- `arc colors` — audit all projects
- `arc colors anivia` — audit specific project
- `arc colors --generate` — pure monochrome palette
- `arc colors --generate --accent blue` — monochrome + accent
- `arc colors --short` — one-liner per project
- `arc colors --json` — machine-readable
- aliases: `arc colors`, `arc palette`
