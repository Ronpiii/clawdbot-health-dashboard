# Reddit Pulse — 2026-02-14

## highlights

### r/SaaS — "cold DMs > forum signups" rant (worth reading)
- SaaS founder frustrated with r/SaaS bot spam on "drop your SaaS" posts
- KEY INSIGHT: "signups from cold DMs are 10X better — they gave feedback, replied, some bought lifetime access" vs forum signups who "literally just signup and do nothing"
- validates ventok's cold outreach approach — quality > volume
- https://reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1r43m29/

### r/SaaS — reddit as sales channel (SubredditSignals plug)
- founder claims 30-35% CTR from reddit replies vs 2-3% from cold email
- built tool to scan subreddits for buying-intent posts, AI-scores them
- interesting competitive intel approach: track where competitors get mentioned, common objections
- the "intent signal" angle is relevant — anivia could surface similar signals for cold email
- https://reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1r430iy/

### r/Affiliatemarketing — "reverse affiliate marketing" = cold outreach with affiliate links
- using AI to analyze prospect profiles, personalize outreach per product
- 5-8% conversion vs 0.5-1% from link dropping
- segmenting by industry, company size, tech stack
- basically reinvented what ventok does but for affiliate commissions
- https://reddit.com/r/Affiliatemarketing/comments/1r43r92/

### r/Emailmarketing — sending domain confusion (common pain point)
- person asking: subdomain vs new domain? alias vs new google account?
- this is EXACTLY the kind of question anivia's onboarding could answer automatically
- feature idea: domain setup wizard in anivia
- https://reddit.com/r/Emailmarketing/comments/1r40qe4/

### r/Emailmarketing — HTML email frustrations
- outlook breaking layouts, mobile rendering, clunky builders
- people still exporting figma designs as PNGs for emails (yikes)
- confirms: email tooling UX is still painful in 2026
- https://reddit.com/r/Emailmarketing/comments/1r413ti/

### r/coldoutreach — Smartlead.ai reviews requested
- people actively comparing tools, asking for honest opinions
- smartlead is a direct competitor — worth monitoring what people love/hate
- https://reddit.com/r/coldoutreach/comments/1qu4tej/

## takeaways for ventok
1. cold DM/outreach quality >> forum/inbound quality — keep building on this
2. "intent signals" from reddit/social is a growing niche — multiple people building tools for it
3. domain setup remains a major friction point for new cold emailers — anivia opportunity
4. smartlead is the tool people are evaluating — track their gaps
5. AI-personalized outreach at 5-8% conversion is the benchmark people are hitting
