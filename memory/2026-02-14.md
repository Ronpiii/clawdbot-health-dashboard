## nightly build: service health monitor (00:00 UTC)

### what
- built `arc pulse` — live service health monitor for all production endpoints
- checks anivia, ventok.eu, collabo, supabase, health dashboard, moltbook in parallel
- reports status (up/degraded/down/timeout), HTTP status codes, response times with visual latency bars
- grouped by category: infrastructure, applications, websites, social
- critical services marked with `!` — alerts when critical services are down
- history tracking: stores last 100 checks in `memory/pulse-history.json`
- uptime percentages and latency stats (avg/min/p95/max) per service
- watch mode: `--watch N` for continuous monitoring every N seconds
- all checks run in parallel — full scan completes in <1 second

### first run results
- 6/6 services up, 100% operational
- avg response time: 86ms
- fastest: ventok.eu (11ms — static site, zone.eu hosting is fast)
- slowest: anivia (195ms — vercel cold start on first hit)
- supabase responds in 21ms (401 without apikey, but server is alive)

### commands
- `arc pulse` — full dashboard with latency bars
- `arc pulse --short` — one-liner: `pulse: 6/6 up | avg 86ms`
- `arc pulse --history` — uptime percentages + latency trends over time
- `arc pulse --watch 30` — continuous monitoring every 30s
- `arc pulse --json` — machine-readable output

### aliases
- `arc pulse`, `arc ping`, `arc uptime`

### why
- ron has 6+ production services running. no way to check them all at once.
- pairs with `arc health` (workspace health) and `arc shield` (security) — now we have operational monitoring too
- history accumulates over time via heartbeats — eventually shows real uptime trends
- the kind of thing you run after a deploy to make sure nothing broke

## notes
- quiet friday, no user activity
- all heartbeat checks stable throughout the day
- moltbook agent still unclaimed — queued post can't be sent
- submodule pointer diffs (discord-voice-bot, tuner) still uncommitted — cosmetic only
