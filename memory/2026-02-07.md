## security alert — clawdhub supply chain attack (11:03 UTC)
- ron shared article: top downloaded clawdhub skill ("Twitter") was malware
- attack chain: skill SKILL.md → fake dependency "openclaw-core" → external staging page → obfuscated payload → second-stage script → binary with gatekeeper bypass
- key insight: the AI agent is the social engineering target, not the human
- audited our setup: CLEAN — all skills are bundled core, no third-party installs
- wrote full security notes → `memory/security-notes.md`
- added permanent defense rules for skill installation

## autonomy directive (12:26 UTC)

- updated USER.md
