# Website Design Prompts

Specialized master prompts for different website verticals. Each builds on the philosophy from `master-website-prompt.md` (concept-first, not rules-first) but tailored to the specific patterns, typography, color, layout, and animation conventions of each industry.

## Prompts

| File | Vertical | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| `agency.md` | Digital/marketing agencies, consultancies | work showcase, technical craft, client trust |
| `studio.md` | Design/creative/dev studios | personal voice, handcrafted feel, opinionated |
| `creative.md` | Artists, photographers, portfolios | personal brand, image presentation, minimal chrome |
| `fashion.md` | Fashion brands, luxury, lifestyle | atmosphere, desire, editorial imagery, e-commerce |
| `manufacturing.md` | Industrial, manufacturing, B2B | precision, trust signals, data, real photography |

## Usage

Drop any of these as a system prompt or .cursorrules when building a site in that vertical. Each prompt includes:
- Creative concept directions (pick one as starting point)
- Category-specific typography (fonts, sizes, pairings)
- Color palettes with actual hex values
- Layout patterns unique to the category
- Animation timing and interaction patterns
- Page structure
- Reference sites to study
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## Parent Prompt

For a general-purpose website prompt (not category-specific), see `master-website-prompt.md` in the workspace root.
