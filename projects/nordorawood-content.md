## Products

### 1. Decking (Terrassid)
**Description:** Thermal modification reduces wood density, making it lighter while significantly improving durability. Highly resistant to weather conditions and fungal decay. Lower moisture content means boards remain stable in shape and dimensions even in changing moisture conditions.

**Also offer:** finishing service with customer's preferred oil or paint.

**Thermopine sizes:**
- 25 × 90 mm
- 25 × 118 mm
- 25 × 138 mm

**Thermoash:** available on request

---

### 2. Cladding / Facades (Fassaadid)

#### Exterior Cladding (Välisvoodrilaud)
Thermally modified wood is a poor conductor of heat, durable, dimensionally stable, and visually distinctive. Compared to untreated wood, thermowood withstands outdoor conditions much better — ideal for exterior cladding and façades. Recommend treating with natural wood oil containing UV protection.

#### Interior Cladding (Sisevoodrilaud)
Suitable for buildings with high humidity and fluctuating temperatures: summer houses, outdoor kitchens, garden buildings, garages. Also works as a decorative element for interior design.

**Also offer:** finishing with customer's preferred oil or paint.

**Thermopine / Thermospruce sizes:**
- 19 × 40 mm
- 19 × 68 mm
- 19 × 90 mm
- 19 × 118 mm
- 19 × 138 mm

**Profiles:** various (details on request)

**Note:** custom profiles available if the standard range doesn't fit the project.

### 3. Saunas (Saunad)
Thermally modified wood retains all its core properties, including heat insulation. Combining both thermo and regular wood in a sauna creates a unique result. Product range includes bench boards (lavalaud) and interior cladding boards (voodrilaud) in various dimensions.

**Interior cladding (voodrilaud) sizes:**
- 16 × 65 mm
- 16 × 85 mm
