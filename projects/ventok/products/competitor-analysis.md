## Key Insights

### Market Gaps

1. **No one owns full funnel**
   - Tools either do outreach OR CRM, never both well
   - Opportunity: outreach + pipeline + close in one

2. **AI is bolted-on, not native**
   - Most tools added AI to existing workflows
   - Opportunity: AI-first design from ground up

3. **Vertical-specific solutions missing**
   - Everything is generic B2B
   - Opportunity: manufacturing-specific features

4. **SMB pricing gaps**
   - AI SDR tools (11x, Artisan) are enterprise-only
   - Opportunity: AI SDR for SMBs at €300-800/mo

5. **European market underserved**

   - Opportunity: EU data, EU languages, GDPR-native

6. **CRM + AI outreach not integrated**
   - Attio has great CRM, no outreach

   - Opportunity: unified platform

### What Winners Have in Common

1. **Named AI agents** — Alice (11x), Ava (Artisan), Sera's 6 agents
2. **Quality over quantity** — anti-spam positioning
3. **Human oversight** — AI + human hybrid
4. **Credit/usage pricing** — pay for what you use
5. **Deliverability focus** — warmup, reputation protection
6. **Self-serve + demo** — try before buy

### What's Missing (Build This)

1. **Manufacturing-specific CRM + AI**
   - Product catalogs, pricing, specs
   - Integration with production systems
   - Order → production handoff

2. **Full funnel AI**
   - Research → Outreach → Nurture → Close → Onboard
   - Not just outreach

3. **European-first**
   - Estonian, German, Nordic languages native
   - GDPR baked in
   - EU company data

4. **Approval queue workflow**
   - AI does work, human approves
   - Confidence scores
