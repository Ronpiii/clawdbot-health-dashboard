### 4. Google Maps Scraping

- Screenshot business listings
- Check reviews for company size hints
- Look at Street View for facility size

### 5. LinkedIn Sales Navigator
If you have access:
- Filter: Estonia + Manufacturing + 11-50 employees
- Look for "tegevjuht" (CEO) or "tootmisjuht" (production manager)

### 6. Competitors' Case Studies
Check websites of:
- Other Estonian automation agencies
- Airtable consultants
- Make.com partners

Who are they serving? Those are validated targets.

## Qualification Criteria

### Hot Leads (prioritize)
- 20-100 employees
- Manufacturing/logistics/wholesale
- No obvious ERP on website
- Growing (check revenue trends in ariregister)
- Owner-managed (not subsidiary)

### Warm Leads
- 10-20 or 100-200 employees
- Might have basic systems but scaling pains
- Recent job postings for operations roles

### Cold Leads (deprioritize)
- Very small (<10) - no budget
- Very large (>250) - already have IT dept
- Foreign subsidiary - decisions made elsewhere
- Tech companies - already digitalized

## Enrichment Process

For each qualified lead:
1. Find decision maker on LinkedIn
2. Check company news (expansion? new facility?)
3. Look for pain signals in job postings
4. Note any mutual connections
5. Check if they've worked with agencies before

## Email Finding

- firstname.lastname@company.ee (Estonian standard)
- firstname@company.ee (smaller companies)
- info@company.ee (last resort, goes to admin)
- LinkedIn direct message as backup

Verification: hunter.io or similar

## Outreach Priority Order

1. **Wood manufacturing** (TMW reference pending)
2. **Metal fabrication** (similar processes)
3. **Food production** (inventory + compliance heavy)
4. **Logistics/warehousing** (WMS sweet spot)
5. **Wholesale** (inventory + orders)
