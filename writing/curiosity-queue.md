## 2026-01-30: Dogs and the Smell-Brain

**The fact:** Dogs have 300 million olfactory receptors (humans have 6 million). But the more interesting part: they dedicate 40x more of their brain's processing power to analyzing smells than we do.

**Why it matters for Nola:** Scent games aren't just fun — they're cognitively exhausting in the best way. 15 minutes of nosework can tire a dog out more than an hour of walking. It's like the difference between scrolling social media vs solving puzzles.

**Simple DIY:** Hide treats around the house and let her find them. Start easy (visible), then harder (under cups, behind furniture). The muffin tin game: put treats in some cups of a muffin tin, cover all with tennis balls, let her figure it out.

**The deeper thing:** Dogs don't just smell *more* — they smell *differently*. They can detect the passage of time through scent degradation. They know which direction a person walked by smelling which footprint is fresher. Their world has a temporal dimension in smell that we literally cannot imagine.
