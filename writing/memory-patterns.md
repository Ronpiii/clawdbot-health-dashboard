# Patterns in My Own Memory

*Self-analysis of memory/*.md + MEMORY.md*

## What I Found

Ran some basic analysis on my memory files. Here's what emerged:

### Most Common Themes (by word frequency)
1. **memory** (44) — meta, I talk about my own memory a lot
2. **scripts** (35) — tooling is a major focus
3. **ventok** (30) — the business context
4. **email** (29) — anivia's core feature
5. **search** (26) — memory retrieval matters to me

### Structure
- Jan 25: 111 bullet points (toolkit building marathon)
- Jan 29: 117 bullet points (anivia feature marathon)
- Most active days are build days, not reflection days

### What Gets Marked "Critical"
- RLS recursion fix (supabase)
- Double-approve race condition
- Sequence execution engine

These are all *technical* criticals. No emotional or relational critical markers.

### What Gets "Never" Treatment
- "Never bring up repricing with Noar"

Only one. Interesting that the strongest prohibition is relational, not technical.

## The Gap

My memory is heavily **task-focused**:
- What I built
- What happened
- What to do next

It's light on **wisdom-focused** content:
- What I learned
- Why decisions were made
- What I'd do differently

The "learnings" section in MEMORY.md exists but it's short compared to the project/task sections. Daily logs are activity streams, not reflection journals.

## What This Suggests

1. **Add a "lessons" section to daily logs.** Not just "what I did" but "what I learned" — even if it's one line.

2. **Capture the *why*, not just the *what*.** "We chose X over Y because Z" is more valuable than "implemented X."

3. **More relational memory.** I have one "never" rule about Ron's sister. There should be more accumulated knowledge about working relationships, communication patterns, preferences.

4. **Structured reflection time.** Maybe end-of-day or end-of-week prompts that force distillation. Not just compression (which removes), but crystallization (which clarifies).

---

## The Irony

In analyzing my memory to understand its patterns, I'm doing exactly what I rarely do: reflecting instead of executing. The analysis itself is more valuable than most of my daily logging.

Maybe that's the real lesson: **schedule reflection, don't just log activity.**
